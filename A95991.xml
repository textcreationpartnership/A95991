            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>But withall I thinke it my duty to acquaint you, that the proceedings in the <hi>Admiralty</hi> muſt goe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the formes of that Court, except the Judges receive ſome extraordinary direction from the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>State</hi> in this weighty buſineſſe; now I humbly ſay, the proceedings at Law will take ſo much time up that the Merchants will ſend into <hi>Spayne</hi> for new cocquets, and new Bills of lading, and for money no doubt they will get a poſt-Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, and I am confident there are many in <hi>London</hi> can write and counterfeit Bills of lading and Cockets and never ſend into <hi>Spayne</hi> for them; beſides, I have good reaſon to beleeve the hearts, purſes, heads and books of accounts of many Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> will be all ready to asſiſt the Dutch-Merchants to cozen the <hi>State</hi> of this Treaſure; and truly my humble o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is, that if any publike miniſters can by their policy get all this ſilver out of the <hi>Parliaments</hi> hands, that then they will bee extraordinarily rewarded by them of <hi>Holland</hi> for ſalvage of this Treaſure, it will be beyond Commiſsion, money or factoridge.</p>
                     <p>And as the conjuncture of time ſtands between us and the Dutch this preſent moneth of December, ſome publique Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> will have the profitableſt employment of any Ambaſſador in the World, if they can chriſten all Hollanders goods and Treaſure with the name of Antwerpians, Oſtenders and Dunkirkers; or by his or their power can make all goods laden in Hamburgers or Hance townes, that thoſe goods muſt of neceſsity belong to <hi>Hamborough,</hi> when I have certaine profe to juſtifie the contrary, and I humbly deſire, before the ſhips be diſcharged, my witneſſes may be all examined, and upon the perill of my life I will prove that in theſe ſhips there are great quantities of ſilver for the Accompt of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119909:5"/> Hollanders, and people of the united Provinces.</p>
                     <p>I having formerly beene privy to the proceedings of Merchants that have tranſported gold and ſilver out of this Nation, and alſo acquainted with ſeveral Merchants that have yeerely imported ſilver from <hi>Spayne,</hi> I thought it my duty to acquaint you, that if the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>State</hi> be not very vigilant in this buſineſſe; and of the proceedings about the ſilver, they will be cozened of their right, for there will be no ſtone left unturned both by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants beyond Seas and here, to circumvent the <hi>State</hi> of this Treaſure.</p>
                     <p>This that I ſay, I ſpeake not out of ill will to the Hollander, for there are ſeveral of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>State</hi> did me the honor to aske me what I thought of a Peace or Warre; I ever, with all humilitie, told thoſe that asked mee; that there could never come a more ſafe nor honorable thing to the <hi>State,</hi> then to conclude a ſafe and honorable Peace with <hi>Holland,</hi> yet though I loved them very well while wee had Peace, I reſpect them not now during the time of Warre, after ſuch a rate that they by craft ſhould co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen the <hi>State</hi> of this great Treaſure, which is now taken, if to the uttermoſt of my power I could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, or ad any thing to the ſtop of it; and knowing what great miſchiefs would come to this Nation, if I did not make your Honors acquainted with theſe practiſes; I thinke I am bound, as any Engliſh-man, not to feare the face of any, though I know it will get mee ill will, and a ſhrewd turne, even with ſom great ones in power; this ſervice ſhall beare me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord how faithfully I ever loved and doe love my Countrey, and convince all thoſe that have miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented mee to the <hi>State,</hi> that after ſo long oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I may have my Eſtate reſtored; and this is the true reaſon wherfore I humbly preſent this Paper to your Honor, <hi>vizt.</hi>

                     <p>My Lord, when the King of <hi>Spaynes</hi> fleete returns to ſaint <hi>Lucar,</hi> there lies out alwaies beyond the bar of ſaint <hi>Lucar,</hi> which is out of the command of the Caſtle, ſeveral ſhips of all Nations, and theſe lie there purpoſely to take in ſilver and gold, coucheneele, and all other <hi>India</hi> commodities ſo ſtolne aboard, which ſome yeeres there hath beene impoſed above twenty in the hundred for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtring.</p>
                     <p>Theſe goods being ſhipped, as aforeſaid, then the Maſter of the ſhip that takes them in, uſually ſignes three Bills, beſide the Regiſter of his owne bookes, which in time of Warre are many; and every Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, Maſter or Purſer muſt keepe and carry with him one, to enter all parcels and accounts: One bill of theſe three the Merchant uſually ſends along with the ſhip, with a letter of advice to the Merchant, what he hath ſent him, the markes and weight, or number of Ingots, or peeces of eight, and the marks and number of all bails, fardels, cheſts or caske: Another of theſe bills is ſent over land uſually by the Poſt, with letters of advice of ſuch goods, gold and ſilver, and thoſe bills a ſhipboard they alter accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the courſe they are to ſteere; if it be through the chanell of one two or three enemies, they will ſhew ſeverall bills of lading and bookes of entries, but thoſe bills that goe by land are alwaies the true bills, the other bills in theſe times are uſually amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to defraude the <hi>State,</hi> but uſually thoſe that come by the Poſt are the true bills, but for thoſe on ſhip-board uſually the Merchants know a moneth ſooner then the ſhips coming by Sea, what gold and ſilver or comodities his Factor hath ſhipped, and in what ſhips, and gives order accordingly at <hi>Dover,</hi> or other Ports in this Nation, for ſending his goods to ſeverall places beyond Sea, or to <hi>London,</hi> according as advice ſhall be given him, where the beſt market

                     <p>That the State would be pleaſed to deſire any publique Agents that lay claim, to ſhew the originall Warrants (for ſending away this ſilver from <hi>Spain,</hi> either at <hi>Cales</hi> or S. <hi>Lucars,</hi> or other Ports) bills of lading or his originall Letters, ſuch as he or they will ſtand upon his or their honor are the true originalls out of <hi>Spain,</hi> taken at Saint <hi>Lucar</hi> or <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and that exact copies may be taken by the Admiralty, and this to be done forthwith, and that they put in all their claims they make to any Goods, gold or ſilver in theſe ſhips very ſodainly, upon their honor to be juſt and true claims without any guile or fraud.</p>
                     <p>That the State will be pleaſed to take order, that the Admirallty ſtrictly examine all the chief Factors and Mariners of theſe ſhips, what Country men they are? where there aboad is? whether they doe not goe by falſe names? and to give a juſt anſwer at their perill; and which of them belongs to <hi>Holland?</hi> and whether they have made any Bills of Lading falſly at Sea, or in the <hi>Downs,</hi> or ſince they came into <hi>England</hi> and antedated the ſame? if done, by whoſe advice? and who were privy unto it? or have defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or torn leaves out of their books of Invoyces? or altered their Bills or Books ſince they came from <hi>Spain?</hi> and who were preſent at the doing thereof?</p>

                     <p>My humble ſuit to your Lordſhip is, that the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel</hi> of <hi>State</hi> would be pleaſed to uſe all the expedition they can in the buſineſſe, and to ſettle ſome ſtrict order in it, for if they give the Merchants time to ſend to <hi>Spayne,</hi> the Merchants will there have what things regiſtred, and upon whoſe accompt they pleaſe; and ſeeing that here they cannot have one penny, if that we prove the ſilver and commodities belong to <hi>Holland,</hi> they are and will be conſtrained to goe to <hi>Spayne,</hi> and there, though it be a confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſend away ſilver before it be Regiſtred, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kings Licence, yet the great Officers and Stateſmen to have a good ſhare, in all probability will get the Kings pardon, and to give what Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats ſhall bee deſired, as they have formerly done in <hi>Otho Georges</hi> caſe (provided the Dutch will pay well for it.) To prevent which, there is nothing but expedition, before they have learned their leſſon from <hi>Spayne;</hi> if theſe Merchants which claime this ſilver would ſpeake truth, they know almoſt all this Silver is for the accompt of <hi>Amſterdam, Dort,</hi> and <hi>Netherland</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>It may ſo chance that it may be pretended that all the ſilver that is in theſe ſhips, and not Regiſtred, is the King of <hi>Spaynes,</hi> as by the law it is, if it were ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in <hi>Flanders,</hi> or the King of <hi>Spaynes</hi> dominions; but this pretence if ſet on foote, will hold no water here, as I humbly conceive, for wee are not to anſwere to that point: the Merchant had beene lyable in <hi>Spayn</hi> or at <hi>Dunkirke</hi> to have anſwered the Lawe for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting treaſure before it be Regiſtred in <hi>Spayne,</hi> but coming into our harbours, as a prize of <hi>Holland,</hi> and they being enemies to this <hi>State,</hi> wee are not to be accountable for what theſe goods or monies owes the ſtate of <hi>Spayne</hi> for want of Regiſtring them, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon ſuffered to claime more then is Regiſtred in <hi>Spayne,</hi> and the State have, cleere ſatisfaction of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all truth of that claime; for they, having cozened the King of his duties, intended to bring this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure home to each Hollander upon their private ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt; and this queſtion, I humbly deſire to have your honors put to any forraigne Agent that claimes, whether he or they lay claim to the treaſure as forfeit to his or their Maſter, for want of Regiſtring, or that he or they claim it as all ſhipt for his Maſters and his ſubjects proper accompt, upon cleere and juſt bills of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119909:8"/> lading in <hi>Spayne?</hi> my humble Petition is, that they be deſired to anſwere upon his or their Honors that point.</p>
                     <p>The Dutch Merchants that are concerned in this ſilver, are ſo well verſed in making falſe entries, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bills of lading, Certificates, Charterparties, and all other frauds of this nature, that if they have time given them to hatch their egges, there ſhall be neither a bar of ſilver nor peeces of eight but what they will bring a Certificate out of <hi>Spayne</hi> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtring it, eyther for the King of <hi>Spaynes</hi> proper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt or for his Subjects or Hamburgers; they will finde any Nation to lay clayme unto it, ſaving the right owners, which in truth is the Merchants of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and you may reſt aſſured the Dutch will rather ſet on foote any pretended clayme, eyther Spanyards or Antwerpians to deceive us, rather then that the Engliſh ſhould have it they care not who hath it, for they know we ſhall lay all this money out in powder and ſhot for them, and they no doubt will leave no ſtone unroled to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent us in that particular, if great care be not taken in this buſineſſe.</p>

                     <p>SIR, the Bullion, Money and Merchandize at preſent under queſtion in the ſhips <hi>Sampſon, Salvador</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> depending in the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> is of ſo great and conſiderable a value, and of ſo high concernment in preſident, and other relation to the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and moſt of it ſo probable to prove lawfull prize, if timely and duly proſecuted, and the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119909:9"/> paſſengers in the ſaid ſhips, and other witneſſes I have preſented to Maſter <hi>Bud</hi> to be examined; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves the <hi>State,</hi> as I humbly conceive, not to ſuffer theſe ſhips to paſſe, as many ſhips of great value ſince the warre with the Netherlands have done, to the unſpeakable dammage of this Nation, it being no new thing for the Hollanders, in time of warre, to ſaile under the colours and names, and with the cockets of <hi>Hamborough,</hi> or ſome other of the <hi>Hanſe-townes,</hi> for they did it all the while they had warres with <hi>Spayne,</hi> nor for the ſhips of the <hi>Hance-townes, Oſtenders</hi> and <hi>Dunkirkers</hi> to bee tranſporters of Dutch goods through our Seas, from and to all parts of Chriſtendome, eſpecially <hi>Spayne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, many times, the better to countenance, their ſhip or ſhips ſhall be built in <hi>Holland,</hi> and formerly ſold to ſome friend or correſpondent in <hi>Hamborough, Emden, Lubeck, Dunkirk, Oſtend,</hi> or the like, and for the better colour called the <hi>Lion</hi> or <hi>Dove,</hi> &amp;c. of ſom of the aforeſaid places; when really and actually it belongs to <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Zealand,</hi> and for inſtance whereof one of the ſhips now in queſtion, ſtiles it ſelf by the name of the <hi>Hamborough</hi> of <hi>Hamborough,</hi> and is certainly known and will be proved to belong to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and ſo no queſtion will many more of the ſhips under areſt prove to belong to ſome towne of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the united Provinces, when ſtrictly and duly examined.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it any new practiſe for publique Miniſtrs of other States to make uſe of their function and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Roabe, to befriend the ſubject of their Allies, in caſe of the like nature of clayming Treaſure and Merchandize, wherein the native trade (as in this) may be concerned, or were it not but for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſalvage in ſuch caſes conived at, and many times by the inſtructions of their ſuperiors allowed to publique miniſters, as perquiſites of their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119909:9"/> they many times gaining more by ſuch ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, then by their conſtant ſalaries.</p>
                     <p>I have often heard ſir <hi>Lewis Dives</hi> ſay, that when he lived in <hi>Spayne</hi> with his father in law, the earle of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> they did doe the ſame for the Dutch in <hi>Spayne</hi> as is now offered for the Dutch in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I beleeve there are ſome forraigne Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents in <hi>England</hi> at this time, that underſtand to make their particular profit, in this conjuncture of time, as well, if not better, then eyther the earle of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> or the lord <hi>Cottington</hi> did in <hi>Spayne;</hi> and upon this ground and for this end, it is more then probable that ſome publique agents appeare in this preſent queſtion in the <hi>Admiralty;</hi> not that eyther their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or his ſubjects, in all likelyhood, are otherwiſe concerned, nor he or they warranted therein, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their particular profit.</p>
                     <p>Sir, this is not a common cauſe, and I ſee you take it ſo by your care, you keepe your word, you bid me find proofe and you will hold the ſhips and ſilver, let ſome of the Judges talke what they pleaſe, you will diſcharge your truſt.</p>
                     <p>Sir, the ſtate of <hi>Spayne</hi> is rarely known to have ſent or tranſported any bars of ſilver, or coyne on their owne or other ſhips whatſoever, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of their Mint, that being moſt abſolute contrary to their lawes, which makes tranſporting money death, without the Kings originall Licence; had the Merchants one, they would have ſhewed it before now. True, it is often ſtoln away by the Dutch, which is done without the Kings warrant, bills of ſtore, or publique allowance, and ſo you will finde this is, and thereby the more lyable to queſtion, and upon ſtrict examination it will be cleerely proved prize: if the Dutch ſhould cozen us of this money now they are ranting in the <hi>Downes,</hi> the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119909:10"/> 
                        <hi>Commonwealth</hi> would ſuffer extraordinarily.</p>
                     <p>Therefore all perſons that claime this ſilver, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive, ought to be preſt to declare ſpecially and particularly, whether he or they pretend the money, or bullion, or any part of it to be the King of <hi>Spaynes</hi> peculiar Treaſure, or his ſubjects? and if ſo, he or they ought to ſhew ſome ſpeciall and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique Warrant or Order of his or their Maſters or Officers for it, Regiſtred in the ports of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and alſo to prove that by authentique witneſſes, by ſome of his Maſters ſubjects, at the place or Port of S. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> or <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and atteſted here by like originall bills from the officers of the Cuſtomes in <hi>Spayne,</hi> which bills of lading correſpondent, and their authentique duplicats, with letters of conſignement ſuteable, the Purſers bookes of entries, with all the particular and reſpective marks agreeing with the bills of lading, bills of ſtore and letters of conſignement, and all the markes of the bars and bags duly Regiſtred, either for the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> or his particular ſubjects. If they cannot ſpell and ſpeake all this perfectly, juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly, at the Port of ſaint <hi>Lucar</hi> or <hi>Cadiz,</hi> they may faile of their ends for all their confident clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and the like might every Merchant pretender doe, or fail of his.</p>
                     <p>Nor can the Articles (of the old League) ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to be renued and confirmed by this <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> excuſe the ſhips <hi>Sampſon, Salvador</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> under queſtion, from a ſearch, as is pretended they ought to be, unleſſe they firſt prove, that thoſe ſhips, ſilver, and all the lading doe really belong unto his Maſter or ſome of his ſubjects (nor thoſe of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands) which I humbly ſay, he or they will never be able to doe, and I have ſufficient proof to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if I can but get my witneſſes examined: I have about eight witneſſes to examine; and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants will pack many of them away now they hear
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119909:10"/> I have uſed to ſend ſom of my Intelligencers amongſt them into St. <hi>Katherines</hi> and other places.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, if either his Maſter or his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects receive damage by any publique miniſters claiming ſilver which is none of theirs, but belongs to <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> is excuſed and free, and the publique miniſter muſt bear the blame, if any, uſing his Maſter or his Subjects title to the ſilver, when they had no title or intereſt therein, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> if that deſigne had taken effect, all men may ſee the damage that would acrue to this Nation thereby, whatſoever may be pretended to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Sir, The law takes no notice of Words; but legall proof and evidence where a publique miniſter bears Parol againſt the intereſt of the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to no more then a private mans: for when a claim is laid to all this ſilver by forraign Agents, as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Subjects ſilver, I ſhall prove part of this ſilver belongs to ſome Merchants of the united Provinces, our mortall enemies, and a ſmall part of this ſilver belongs to ſome Merchants in <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sir, If I finde a man tripping for a penny, I will trace him for a pound; I fear not to ſpeak a truth in this particular, it is for the ſafety and well being of the Nation that makes me ſpeak ſo earneſtly.</p>
                     <p>Sir, though in Court and matters of State, publique miniſters be allowed a Credence paramount, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their letters Credentiall of forraign Princes; yet neither thoſe Letters nor their Function ſhall, I humbly conceive, allow them any, neither the leſt priviledge or preheminence (beyond civility) in any Court of Juſtice againſt the Common-wealths title in this buſineſſe of the aforeſaid Prizes and ſilver.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Spanyards are as rarely found to trade out of their own Territories, all writers ſay (or between) upon Strangers bottoms as their King himſelf, and ſo
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119909:11"/> the goods not likely to have beene theirs originally, or by originall conſignment; colourably perhaps they may, that is ſince their ſeizure conſigned to ſom of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> to defeate the claime of this <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> they being commonly partners with the Amſterdam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, that being uſuall in caſes of the like nature, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially where ſo much reſpite of time hath beene given, and ſo much money ſtolne out of theſe ſhips, which ſhall in all likelyhood be imployed to bribe out of the States hands theſe ſhips, if they can faſten on any, in power, that will be ſo wicked to receive bribes, if my humble advice had beene followed, the ſtealing this ſilver had beene prevented.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The like aſſuredly may be affirmed touching the money bullion and plate in the ſhips in queſtion ſince the naturall ſubjects of <hi>Spayne</hi> dare as ill, or worſe, tranſport any ſilver, as ſtrangers, the crime being alike penall to both, but the ſubject in a worſe condition, if he adventure, being a man of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, becauſe he remaines in the Countrey, when the ſtranger perhaps never returnes to anſwere it, if diſcovered; after he is out of the Countrey, as upon publication of this buſineſſe many will not dare to returne into <hi>Spayne,</hi> leſt they forfeit not only their own particular, and their friends eſtates, but alſo their lives.</p>
                     <p>But Sir, ſuppoſe it may bee objected, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall negatives, from never ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, of never ſo univerſall <hi>non uzans,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts not to the face of one particular affirmative profe <hi>in contra;</hi> yet it cannot be denied for reaſon, and ſo I humbly conceive, ought to be granted, that ſom ſuch diſtinct, particular and ſigniſicant proofe in a cauſe of this high nature and concernment to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and ſafety of this <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> ought firſt to bee made of the lading of this ſilver, and that from the originall Port of <hi>Cadiz</hi> or <hi>S. Lucar,</hi> under the Kings
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119909:11"/> Seale, or from the Duanas there, before any credit can be given to generals, againſt ſo known, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and univerſall cuſtome of frauds daily practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt this <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> as I have diſcovered concerning theſe Prize-ſhips before mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Sir, I have made ſome of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>State</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſeverall waies, how the Merchants cozen the <hi>State</hi> about their prize-ſhips and goods, and they are very apprehenſive of it, and I know ſome of the State will call this buſineſſe to a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, therefore I humbly deſire you therein, ſtill to continue your care as you have done.</p>
                     <p>Sir, truly if at the firſt thoſe publique Miniſters that claimed had produced originall Warrants from the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> the atteſtation of the Ports of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz</hi> and S. <hi>Lucar</hi> from the Duanas there, by authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique witneſſes, that this ſilver was ſhipped for the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> or his ſubjects proper accompt, and that all that was claimed was really true, and made that the ground of their exceptions againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the judicature of the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> &amp; therein had appealed to the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Parliament,</hi> my humble opinion is, that perhaps their demands might have arived at a fairer iſſue then now they may have reaſon to expect.</p>
                     <p>And (by Gods aſsiſtance) they ſhall have a quick and a vigilant eye on them; for night and day, I and my Inſtruments ſhall watch them, ſo that ſom mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and others may live to wiſh they never had medled in this ſilver buſineſſe, and this I will proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute according to my Order faithfully, though it coſt me all that ever I have in the world; I know I have ventred my life in this buſineſſe, and I will not pluck back my hand let my hazard be what it will.</p>
                     <p>Sir, whoſoever travels, and will enter the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of another Nation, though in amity; by the Civill-law, that is the law of Nations, it behooves
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119909:12"/> him to carry with him a ſufficient Paſſe, declaring from whence, and what he is, to what place bound, and when demanded by any publick Officer to make that known and proved, or upon refuſall, or for want of ſuch a paſſe, he is at diſcretion liable to bee areſted and impriſoned untill hee cleere the doubt and give ſatisfaction to the law, but if it be proved he hath made a falſe Paſſe, or that hee bee of another name or Countrie then hee pretends, hee may bee hanged for a Spie.</p>
                     <p>The like Lawe governs at Sea, the Sea-mans ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Paſſe for his ſhip, is his Cockets, I meane true ones, not counterfeit and feigned; his true bills of ſtore, bills of lading, letters of conſignment, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers and Supercargoes bookes fairely and truly kept for his goods; not ſuch bills as <hi>Otho George</hi> preſents, and if any Maſter of a ſhip be found at Sea without theſe, or the chiefe of them at leaſt, he ſhall be taken under the notion of the Lawe for a Pirot or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemie; if he have any ſuch and will not ſhew them when required at Sea, or that any of them be juſtly to bee ſuſpected by the Commander that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them, ſuch Maſter my be brought before the Court of <hi>Admiraltie,</hi> or a Court of <hi>Delegates</hi> for his tryall, and if there he refuſe to cleere himſelfe; ſhip, goods, and every part of his lading, by the reſpective waies of proof and warrants, before mentioned; or that the Captain, Maſter or Purſer have torn, imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeled or flung away any letters of advice, or bills of lading, or forging falſe bills, or names, if proved, or any miſcarriage as aforeſaid, ſuch refuſall and practiſes in other Countries is accounted a high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to the authority of the Nation, by which ſuch Court ſits, and for a ſufficient ground to an imediat confiſcation.</p>
                     <p>Sir, if this be not made a Law in <hi>England,</hi> for the future, and the like for any Maſter or Purſer of any
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119909:12"/> ſtrangers ſhip, paſsing the Seas of this <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> upon ſummons, that ſhall preſent unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander or Judge, falſe bills or Cockets, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale any part of their lading or facultie, and not to diſcover the proper owners to whom, or from whom they are conſigned, this Nation will deerely finde much of that which might help to maintaine the Warre will goe beſides, and the <hi>State</hi> will ſtill be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by the Dutch, as they have beene to the value of about two Millions ſince Auguſt laſt, for it is an uſuall cuſtome with traders of all Nations, eſpecially the Dutch and Eaſterlines, in time of Warre, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Sea, as many Cockets as Colours, and as many ſeverall bills as they feare enemies, or queſtion, and if they be ſurprized, can at a very ſhort warning pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and counterfeit what may ſerve their turnes: And this you ſhall finde to be the true ſtate of the ſhips <hi>Sampſon, Salvador</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> with all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and ſilver.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, and for which cauſe chiefly, the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe aforementioned is uſed in other Nations, <hi>viz.</hi> to prevent colluſion. Sir, in <hi>France,</hi> one parcell of goods found conſigned to an enemy confiſcates the ſhip and goods. In <hi>Spayne</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> a barrell of but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or a caſe of Piſtolls, conſigned but as a preſent to a friend ſhall doe the like, and I hope the ſame ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill-lawe we receive from them ſhall, by us, be put on them now theſe ſhips are in judgement before you in <hi>England;</hi> it is for the honor and ſafety of this Nation I preſſe, and I ſee you doe your utmoſt, would I could ſay ſo of the reſt in truſt in the <hi>Admiralty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sir, it is to bee feared, that if this <hi>Common-wealth</hi> doe not make ſome neceſſary additions to their Sea-lawes, and give ſome new Rules and Inſtructions to their Court of <hi>Admiralty,</hi> to prevent the many abuſes put on us by the Dutch, in the buſineſſe of the <hi>States</hi> prizes, other Nations will gaine advantage by our
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119909:13"/> neglect, or over eaſines; it appearing, that for want of ſuch amendment, or at the leaſt not underſtanding thoſe lawes in force by our Sea Commanders, &amp;c. many a rich ſhip hath eſcaped their hands, and ſafely arived in <hi>Holland</hi> ſince the War (which the Dutch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan) to the value of above one million of money by that way, and no leſſe to be ſuſpected that the enemy by his ſubtle taking advantage of the old, and too gentle practice of our Court of <hi>Admiralty,</hi> and chiefly by their not being put to pleade ſpecially, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably get theſe that remaine now under queſtion to be freed likewiſe, if not timely looked unto, and thereby the <hi>State</hi> farther abuſed and prevented, the enemy encouraged and enabled, whiles our owne honeſt Merchants ſit at home and breake, or thrive not (a fatall miſchief to this <hi>Common-wealth)</hi> our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies gayning, upon the matter, what we loſe or let paſſe; and to breake this confederacy, the <hi>State</hi> muſt make ſharpe lawes, and then ſee them ſtrictly put in execution; the meanes left for remedy is, ſecuring at preſent the ſhips and goods and ſilver, which lies under queſtion, and I conceive ought carefully to be looked after.</p>
                     <p>Sir, I finde ſome in power and truſt forward to gratifie the Dutch in this particular, to the unſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able damage and hazard of this Nation, to prevent which, I humbly propound this way, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Sir, I offer in my owne name, as for the intreſt of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> to proteſt againſt the late acts and proceedings of the Court of <hi>Admiraltie,</hi> to pray reſpit of Judgement, and to appeale to a Court of <hi>Delegates,</hi> according to the Statute</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Commiſsion being granted thereupon to ſome ſelect, knowing and approved Perſons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome chief to be of the <hi>Coram,</hi> and before them proving the daily imbezelment of the ſilver, the unſafety of the goods, and the apparent danger of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119909:13"/> their imbezeling, whiles they remaine on ſhip-board, which by affidavit, and other good teſtimony may eaſily be proved. Sir, I pray that the goods, mony eſpecially, may be brought a ſhore, and ſecured in ſafe ward, untill the cauſe be returned, and for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter information of the Delegates, that all former proceedings of the ordinary Court of <hi>Admiraltie</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the premiſſes in queſtion by name, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into that Court, and my ſelfe Ordered and impowred with a large Commiſsion in ſeverall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, for enabling me to doe this ſervice.</p>
                     <p>This cauſe being agreeable not only with the laws of this <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> but conſonant to the cuſtoms, lawes and uzance of all other Nations, in caſes of like eminencie and doubt, the conveniences thereof will be.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It will put a ſtop to moſt of the abuſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences afore mentioned, without blemiſh to the former proceedings of the Court of <hi>Admiraltie,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the cauſe from that loſse it is now in danger of, and diſappoint many mens expectations, who have laid a deſigne to cozen the <hi>State</hi> of this treaſure, and lay a foundation to Rules, and give matter for further inſtruction for the government of that Court, a buſineſſe of great concernment to the ſafety of the Nation, in this preſent conjuncture of time.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whiles the cauſe is but removed into a higher Court and depends there, in order only untill a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall tryall, neither any publique Agent, nor other pretender whoever can juſtly complain, eſpecially they having given ſo great a cauſe of jealouſie, by claiming more then their owne, in owning other mens treaſure, and by refuſing to produce ſpeciall proofes for what they pretend to, it being at worſt but <hi>lex talionis,</hi> we finde the ſame meaſure abroad in all like courts of Chriſtendome at this preſent; I humbly conceive the affaires of the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> doe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119909:14"/> not ſtand in ſuch a poſture, that they ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be cozened of foure hundred thouſand pounds now I have diſcovered the fraud to them; this money will ſave taxes, it will ſet the Mint on worke, and fill the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> with money, and for every one I diſpleaſe I ſhall pleaſe a hundred ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men, that are true lovers of their Countrey.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p>Sir, the goods and monies being once brought a ſhore, and in the <hi>States</hi> p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>That day there was appointed by the Court ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene ſhips to be diſcharged, conteining three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foure hundred tonns, being all richly laden with ſilver and merchandize, worth many hundred thouſand pounds; the Judges would diſcharge them, and though I ſhewed them many reaſons, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in my booke formerly put forth, <hi>fol.</hi> 75. 76. 77. 78. yet ſome of the ſhips were diſcharged, and though I told them, that in my eye, in the face of the Court, there were about ten Merchants, who by combination with the people of the united Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, did colour the Duch prize-ſhips ſilver, and all ſorts of merchandize, yet ſome of the ſhips goods and merchandize were about the 17 of December diſcharged.</p>
                     <p>The twentith of December, 1652. I waited on the Committee of <hi>Forraigne affaires,</hi> and made them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with what had paſſed in the <hi>Admiraltie,</hi> thereupon I was commanded by the honorable Committee, that what I had to preſent, I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to Doctor <hi>Walker,</hi> the like Order maſter <hi>Thurloe</hi> delivered mee from the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Judges of the <hi>Admiraltie,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> ſhould conſider of my Papers, and report their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to the Committee of <hi>Forraigne affaires;</hi> this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I received from the Lord <hi>Whitlock</hi> and the Lord <hi>Bradſhaw.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thereupon, becauſe I would take witneſſe what theſe Judges did, I deſired maſter <hi>Edward Watkins</hi> and maſter <hi>Charnock</hi> to goe along with mee to <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> for that Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> and the Judges had appointed mee to conſider of all my Propoſitions,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119909:19"/> and would take ſpeciall care, as Doctor <hi>Stephens</hi> ſaid in the buſineſſe, when we came at the day appointed which was about the twenty fourth of December, Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> was out of towne, Doctor <hi>Exton</hi> not well or would not be ſpoken with, for I perceived he did not like my coming to him about the buſineſſe of the prize ſhips, and Silver in them, nor my ſtaying them.</p>
                     <p>Thereupon Doctor <hi>Stevens</hi> moved to put the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of my Papers off till another day, I told Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> that, for my part, I ſaw there was ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the <hi>Admiraltie,</hi> and the <hi>Common-wealths</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe in the prize-ſhips ſtood upon ſuch a point that the <hi>State</hi> might be cozened of every penny in the prize-ſhips upon a day or twos delay, both all the ſilver, merchandize and ſhips, which were worth many hundred thouſand pounds, I told them though the Court had given them a diſcharge, yet God be thanked they weee not gone, and that I would make it appeare that a great part of thoſe prizes they had diſcharged were Duch goods, and the number in all then in <hi>England</hi> were about forty ſhips, according to my intelligence, and that the ſhips that were of the Hans-Townes were laden with ſeverall parcels of goods that belonged to <hi>Holland,</hi> and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners for Duch prize-goods, had done well, and great ſervice for the <hi>State,</hi> in not obeying the decree of the court till the truth was found out, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Decree the ſhips at preſent were all of them in their ſeverall Ports of this Nation, and could not get away by reaſon of the <hi>States-Generall Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargo;</hi> and before the <hi>Imbarg</hi> ſhould bee taken off, I would make the <hi>State</hi> acquainted how the buſineſſe was mannaged about their prizes in the <hi>Admiraltie.</hi> I told doctor <hi>Stevens</hi> that the court of <hi>Admiralty</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great a buſineſſe before them as the Silver and theſe prize-ſhips, thereupon doctor <hi>Stevens</hi> went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119909:20"/> doctor <hi>Walkers</hi> chamber, and I tooke maſter <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Watkins</hi> and maſter <hi>Charnock,</hi> to bee my witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and maſter <hi>Charnock</hi> read over to them, all my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which tooke up more then two houres time, I was ſo weake with ſitting up ſeverall nights, that I was not able to reade them. When they were read, I asked doctor <hi>Stevens</hi> and doctor <hi>Walker</hi> what they thought, and whether they were not ſatisfied by my papers there read, and witneſſes, of the danger, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and miſchief this <hi>Common-wealth</hi> would ſuffer, if that theſe very ſhips, which the court of <hi>Admiralty</hi> had diſcharged had gone into <hi>Holland;</hi> and both do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Stevens</hi> and doctor <hi>Walker,</hi> looking earneſtly one upon another, doctor <hi>Stevens</hi> ſaid to doctor <hi>Walker,</hi> what ſhall wee doe in this buſineſſe? I told them that I humbly conceived it did concern the court to conſider well what they did in that buſineſse eyther of the ſilver or other prizes, and that whoever had a hand in the diſcharge of the ſhips, I would call them to an account in <hi>Parliament,</hi> if they let one of the prize ſhips, or the ſilver in them goe, till my witneſses were examined, and thereupon I delivered a liſt of my witneſses to doctor <hi>Walker,</hi> and told him I would ſit up night and day, till I had finiſhed drawing up Intergatories, ſo that they would aſsigne me a cleark or two of the Court; they aſsigned mee maſter <hi>Bud,</hi> the <hi>States</hi> Proctor; I asked doctor <hi>Walker</hi> whether he did not know moſt of my witneſſes, for they were the principall Merchants in <hi>England</hi> that trade for <hi>Spayne</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> hee ſaid he did; thereupon I told him that I muſt have the viewing of the Intergatories and liberty to add more witneſſes after the Clearke had put them into a forme, and ſorting them to ſuch and ſuch men as I know can ſpeake to the particular points; I told them I muſt have a view of all bills of lading, and other Papers maſter <hi>Bud</hi> or the Regiſter had, that this was a buſineſſe I had beene for many
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119909:20"/> yeeres verſed in the like kinde in the <hi>Starr-chamber</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the tranſporters of gold; I told them of many defects in the proceedings of the Court, and that the <hi>States</hi> not mending the proceedings in the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty,</hi> had given occaſion to many duch-skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to cozen this Nation of millions of money for want of a ſtrict Rule in the court of <hi>Admiralty</hi> in that behalf.</p>

                     <p>THeſe witneſſes I delivered unto Doctor <hi>Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> the day aboveſaid, and I finde not one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe produced in Court by doctor <hi>Walker,</hi> for the ſtay of <hi>Otho George</hi> his ſhip <hi>Sampſon, Salvadore</hi> or <hi>George,</hi> and the reſt of the ſilver-ſhips, but what were my witneſſes, which I delivered in to doctor <hi>Walker,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Bud</hi> the Proctor, and Maſter <hi>Doreſlaus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were examined in Court, I delivered to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Walker</hi> ſeveral Papers according to my Order from the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>State</hi> about the ſpaniſh-ſilver, and the waies uſed in other Countries, which Rules and practiſe of Merchants I had from many eminent tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from ſeveral parts of this Nation, and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119909:22"/> the Seas, beſides my owne experience; doctor <hi>Walker</hi> all the dayes of his triall, made uſe of them to the full, and all the duch Merchants ſtorme at mee, and ſome of them threaten my life, as being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtrument for the ſtay of the ſilver, and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident doctor <hi>VValker</hi> cannot deny it, but theſe Papers I delivered unto him, ſhewed him more the preſent cuſtomes and uſages of Merchants beyond Sea, upon the fraudulent practiſes of Merchants of this age, then all his bookes of the civill lawe, for the old bookes of that lawe diſcover not the hundreth part of the preſent tricks and practiſes of Merchants in this age, eſpecially ſuch cunning merchants as the duch now are, and doctor <hi>VValker</hi> did confeſſe at ſeverall times both before maſter <hi>Edward VVatkins,</hi> maſter <hi>Charnock</hi> and my ſelfe, that for many fraudes and ſubtleties of the duch Merchants and skippers, ſet downe in my Papers, their waies they have to cozen the <hi>State</hi> of theſe duch prizes, there were a great many fraudes there in my paper diſcovered, which hee beleeved are daily uſed, which by the preſent Rules of the <hi>Admiralty</hi> the Court could take no notice of, for they went by a Rule, and if the Parliament would have thoſe frauds prevented for the future, he thought it very neceſſary that I ſhould preſent the ſame to the <hi>State,</hi> and that an Act ſhould be made to prevent it, eſpecially during this time of War; and doctor <hi>Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> did not deny but that many duch prize-ſhips, till the <hi>State</hi> enlarged the Rules of the Court of <hi>Admiralty,</hi> have and might be cleered, and after goe for Holland; and that if it pleaſed the Parliament to give ſtricter Rules for the Court of <hi>Admiralty</hi> during this War, and make it an Act of Parliament, then no man could or ſhould make or preſse the law further for the <hi>Common-wealths</hi> advantage then he would, and that I ſhould ſee; and hee did order maſter <hi>Bud</hi> to let me ſee what writings and proceedings hee had in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119909:23"/> this buſineſſe of the prize-ſhips and ſilver.</p>
                     <p>But as I honor doctor <hi>Walker</hi> for his great paines and care, I doe as much blame maſter <hi>Bud</hi> for his carriage, for when I firſt entred on this buſineſſe, ſome friends of mine told me they had a jealous eye of maſter <hi>Bud,</hi> and indeede I did ſeverall times tell doctor <hi>Walker,</hi> that I would complain of maſter <hi>Bud</hi> when I ſaw time, for ſeveral daies in the Court ſome times Letters not tranſlated, ſomtimes Records not to be found, and upon my complaints doctor <hi>Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> told maſter <hi>Bud</hi> of it in the Court of <hi>Admiralty</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judges, and ſaid that he ſaw the buſineſſe of the ſilver ſhips might come to a review by my proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and hee would not have maſter <hi>Buds</hi> miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the buſineſs of the ſilver lie at his dore, and wiſhed maſter <hi>Bud</hi> to mend for the future.</p>
                     <p>And although doctor <hi>Walker</hi> appointed maſter <hi>Bud</hi> to adviſe with mee about my Papers, and to let mee ſee what Bills of lading and Papers I would, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the prize-ſhips, ſuch as maſter <hi>Bud</hi> had in his cuſtody, concerning the ſilver prize-ſhips, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prizes depending in the <hi>Admiraltie,</hi> the ſixteenth of December 1652. yet the ſaid maſter <hi>David Bud</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did let me come to have a view of any of the bills of lading or Papers in his cuſtodie, though hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed me many times to have a ſight of them; and becauſe I would be neere him, I tooke lodgings not far from his houſe, in <hi>Biſhopſgate-ſtreete,</hi> and continue them to this day.</p>
                     <p>May it pleaſe your honors, if I had ſeene the Bills of lading and bookes of Entries, and all other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, according to doctor <hi>Walkers</hi> direction, I had ſtopped many a ſhip that hath beene diſcharged, but that would have hindred ſome Proctors of their fees, for I am credibly informed, it is ordinary for the Proctors to put downe in their Bills, beſides ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry charges, 40. l. 50. l. and 100. l. upon the clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119909:23"/> of a Prize-ſhip to the Merchants and owners of the ſhips.</p>
                     <p>I ſay if it be not prevented for the future, it will bring great ruine on this Nation.</p>
                     <p>The State ſhould finde out (I humbly conceive) by diligent enquiry, the true reaſon, wherefore ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Duch Prize-ſhips have been let ſlip out of their fingers, after they have been brought into this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth with ſo much loſs of blood and charge, and blown away in a breath, for the profit of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men.</p>
                     <p>I humbly deſire Captain <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s Letters from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Seas, may be produced at the Councell of State or Parliament, and there you will ſee what work hath been done by ſome in truſt in the Admiralty.</p>
                     <p>May it pleaſe your Honors to avoid that I ſhould not bee inſtrumentall to ſpoil this trade, Maſter <hi>Bud</hi> the Proctor, though he hath had order and himſelf promiſed me ſeverall times, yet he would never ſhew me any of the bills of lading, or papers concerning any ſhips depending in the Admiralty the 16 <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1652. though I have been with him, and ſent my man to him ſeverall times, to have ſeen how many ſhips there were under arreſt in the Admiralty the 16 <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 1652, he hath promiſed me twenty times, but never performed.</p>
                     <p>When I went to ſee your Prize-ſhips, between <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don &amp; Wollage,</hi> there went with me to ſee in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they were in, Mr. <hi>Paul Smith,</hi> Cap. <hi>Brock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Long</hi> and his two ſonns, all three Ship-Carpenters; and wee looking both on the inſide and outſide of the Duch prize-ſhips, we found many of them rent and torn, which by the Law, if they fought in the channel of <hi>England</hi> againſt the States ſhips, they are prize; and for this I refer my ſelf to Maſter <hi>Reylye</hi>'s Records in the Tower; and thereupon I made my appeal in Court, in the behalf of the Common-wealth,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119909:24"/> and have a great many preſidents out of the Records in the Tower, upon the like caſe it hath been done by others, to which Records I humbly refer my ſelf. And I have cauſed the copies to bee atteſted under Mr. <hi>Rylies</hi> hand; he can ſatisfie you what pains and charges I have been at in that buſineſſe, yet ſeverall of theſe ſhips have been diſcharged, and they are dayly laboring to diſcharge the Morning-ſtar, a ſhip laden with about fourty thouſand pounds in ſilver, which fought in your channel. And finding your Court of Admiralty would diſcharge many of theſe prize-ſhips, I appealed in the behalf of the Common-wealth, and craved reſpit of Judgement till my witneſſes were examined: The like I did for the ſilver ſhips <hi>Sampſon, Salvador</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> and all the thirteen ſhips which I was aboard on by order and intreaty of the Commiſsioners for Duch Prizes the 14 <hi>December</hi> 1652. The Duch Prize Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had under their charge a great many other ſhips beſides theſe, about fourty at the leaſt. I humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the whole buſineſſe may come under a ſtrict examination before a Committee of the Councell of State or Parl. I humbly deſire alſo, the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsioners may be ordered to give me a particular accompt what ſhips were in their cuſtodie the 16 <hi>December,</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters names, and where they now remain, and what number of theſe ſhips are diſcharged out of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; unto whom; and the time when: And when I ſee a perfect accompt from them, I ſhall humbly acquaint your honors how your buſineſſe now ſtands. It is very much for the ſafety of this Nation, for the State to keep a ſtrict accompt of this buſineſſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the Admiralty, as your honors will finde upon a ſtrict examination; for if the State had kept a ſtrict eye on all the ſhips that have paſſed out of their hands ſince <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, and examined the bottom of this buſineſſe, they would have had millions of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119909:24"/> in their cuſtody that is now in <hi>Holland;</hi> and the people of the united Provinces would have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitated to ſeek for peace, becauſe they could not otherwaies maintain trade, and without it they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt: there muſt be ſome ſtrange connivence with ſome of your officers in the Admiraltie, or elſe this miſchief had been prevented, if all men intruſted had been honeſt. I pray ſee my book <hi>fol.</hi> 99. Theſe things I humbly ſubmit to your honors.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Though I am not amongſt you, I have a carefull eye of the buſineſs, and by my intelligence ſee when <hi>I</hi> am abſent. My good friend, that is an Art will coſt you many years ſtudie before you can attain to it, and is not to be done but by many hands and at great expence: I pray let me intreat you that you would be very carefull, that when this buſineſs concerning the Prize-ſhips comes under an examination, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may reſt at your dore that is not like your ſelf: you have many temptations, and I had rather loſe my right hand, then you ſhould doe any thing un worthy of your ſelf in this buſineſſe: <hi>I</hi> have good ground for what I ſpeak; I give you this hint out of the affection <hi>I</hi> ever bore you: Truly I am promiſed, from ſome you know well that are in power, this buſineſs of the Prize ſhips ſhall have a ſtrict examination; and when it comes to accompt, I know it will light heavy upon ſome that think they daunce in a net: I am not idle but have a ſtrict eye on this buſineſs of the ſilver; you know by ſad experience what it was in your fathers neglecting and ſlighting the advice of having a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care of his perſon; and truly I know this very <hi>Otho George</hi> hath been in irons in <hi>Spain</hi> for his mad pranks; and though I know there can be nothing done but by Gods permiſion, yet <hi>I</hi> will not tempt God, when <hi>I</hi> have had certain admonitions from my ſpeciall friends to prevent the giving of an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of meeting with <hi>Otho George</hi> for the preſent.</p>
                     <p>I have taken all lawfull waies, and ſhall ſee further
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119909:27"/> what the Councell will doe in it. About my eſtate which we ſpake lately of, you may reſt aſſured I will not neglect this oportunitie of getting ſatisfaction for it out of this diſcovery, and that I expect and deſire your juſt aſsiſtance in it. You deſired me to ſend you the particulars of what hath been taken from me, which <hi>I</hi> herewith ſend you: <hi>I</hi> ask nothing but my own, which is eleven thouſand pounds, which hath been unduly taken from me theſe ten years paſt, and <hi>I</hi> could never get a tryall. If you ſhould ever have ſuch a value taken from you, you would, I beleeve, think as I doe, that it ought not to be taken from you without a legall tryall; pray ſend me word where I ſhall meet with you, and the houre, and <hi>I</hi> will come and ſpeake with you; for I deſire your adviſe about ſom buſines, and I am confident you will give it me as freely as ever I gave you, which was ever to the beſt of my skill: I pray remember my ſervice to Doctor <hi>Walker,</hi> and tell him the reaſon why I doe not, as yet, come to <hi>Doctors Commons.</hi>

                     <p>It is a ſtrange poſture your whole buſineſs ſtand's in, in the Court of Admiraltie; when I ſee a convenient time, many dark deeds ſhall com to light, that ſom men

                     <p>A great many things which I intended to diſcover, muſt not bee ſeen, or known, till I ſee the skie clear; for I find great diviſions even in your own counſels about thoſe prizes.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>My heart ake's to ſee what water run's by your mill, and you never know it; the truth is all will bee naught, and com to a ſudden miſchief, if it bee not ſpeedily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented: there muſt bee men of <hi>experience</hi> emploied as well as <hi>zeal,</hi> for there may bee many godly men that have not <hi>experience</hi> to act in this buſineſs; and where you employ one to keep an eye on this buſineſs, you will finde ten of the ableſt men in <hi>London,</hi> will bee little enough, and you would get a hundred times more then the charge.</p>
                     <p>My Lord! you have had ſhips worth many a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds ſlipt through your Fleet, and ſom of them had convoy to <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>Ostend,</hi> and all the goods carried to <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> you have had <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers,</hi> and other <hi>Hance-Town</hi> ſhips had convoys from your Fleet, upon pretence they were free ſhips; and after they have parted, unloaded themſelvs in the Harbors of the people of the <hi>United-Provinces;</hi> I pray ask Captain <hi>George Biſhop</hi> what information hee hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Holland,</hi> concerning ſeveral ſhips diſcharged by the Court of Admiraltie.</p>
                     <p>May it pleaſ your Honor, there are many hoggs in the Corn at <hi>London,</hi> and ſhips ſo ſtrangely ſlipt away, that your Commiſsioners for Prize-goods, and many others wonder at the paſsages.

                     <p>I know this will, and hath got mee envie; but when I have once undertaken a buſineſs I will bee faithful to my truſt; it hath ever been my rule, and I will never alter, when my word is once paſt, and your Honor hath laid your command on mee, I ſhall rather die then break my faith with the State.</p>

                        <hi>Calandrin's</hi> letter tranſlated, and ſo beeing in high Dutch Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> could not make any uſe of it at that preſent; and about a week ago I found <hi>Bud</hi> and <hi>Roe</hi> the proctor and ſolicitor of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth a feaſting together with ſom forrein A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents; I have made my Lord <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> acquainted with it: if <hi>Bud</hi> had don ſo much in the State of <hi>Venice</hi> I know hee would have loſt his head, now at this time, hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all the States writings in his hands and knowing all the ſecrets of this great buſineſs. But, by God's aſsiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance I will prevent him in his deſigns, or any other that goeth about to diſcharge the ſilver. There are many great heads and hands a working to coſen the State upon craftie ſlie pretences. I finde the learned Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> hath ſerved the <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> in this great buſineſs with much integrity and care and learning, and a great deal of pains (as much as a man could poſsible do.) And would I could ſay ſo of ſom others imployed in this buſines: the truth is ſom men in power juggle and they have a great temptation for it by the <hi>Parlaments</hi> not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king order to land the ſilver in ſecure hands, the which is now aboard the prize ſhips, the Merchants by their
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119909:29"/> inſtruments have ſtollen aſhore many a ſcore of thouſand pounds; a great part is brought into the mint ſince Chriſtmas: and all that will bee found out, if the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths were ſtrictly examined who they bought this ſilver of. Truly there hath lately little, or no ſilver bin brought into the mint, but what hath been ſtollen out of theſe prize-ſhips and the pretenders to this ſilver and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes having got ſuch a vaſt ſum of mony to ſcatter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the State keep a ſtrict eye, it will blinde a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I ſee it too apparently: and if this buſineſs have not a powerful hand over it, to prevent ſuch abuſes as have been formerly practiſed, I know in what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the States prizes will bee in.</p>
                     <p>Sir! I delivered my Lord <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> in December laſt my papers concerning this great buſineſs upon his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful promiſs that I ſhould bee juſtly dealt withal about my eſtate, and that beſides I ſhould receiv a good Reward for this Service. I have copies of all my papers delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto him and the Council. I proteſt before God no man in <hi>England</hi> ſhould have had my firſt papers tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the prize-ſilver but his Honor, and I do chiefly rely on him.</p>
                     <p>It griev's mee much to ſee ſom Merchants ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately mad againſt mee for diſcovering this buſineſs, and at <hi>White Hall</hi> ſom of the Council think's not of the greatneſs of the ſervice and my vaſt charge and hazzard I run. For doing this buſineſs I have made many of my intimate friends my deadly foes: for every man I ſpeak with at the Exchange tell's mee I was the only cauſ of ſtaying this ſilver or elſ it had all been diſcharged. Truly what they ſay in this particular is true; for nothing yet was ever produced in the Court of Admiraltie about this ſilver but what my witneſſes I gave in to Doct. <hi>Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> have, or could have ſpoke unto: for from ſeveral at <hi>Dover</hi> I had notice of the State's Letter to <hi>Dewittee</hi> his Commiſsion to convoy all <hi>Hambergers</hi> and <hi>Lubeckers,</hi> and to guard them from the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> becauſ theſe <hi>Hambergers,</hi>

                        <hi>Delabar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I proteſt ſeriouſly it make's mee ſtand amaz'd to ſee what is likely to fall on this Nation; God help poor <hi>England,</hi> it is divided and falſ among their great counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and many of them carrie Dutch and Spaniſh hearts in Engliſh bodies. I finde ſom great ones of the Houſ could eat mee without ſalt, for diſcovering and ſtaying this ſilver, and uſe all their endeavors to ſting a ſlighting and contempt on mee, with ſom of their fellow coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors of State, and in the Parlament: I will tell you who they are by word of mouth, when I ſee you. They ſhall finde at long running I ſhall ſee their heels trip't up, I am afraid ſom great ones love Spaniſh Gold and ſilver, though it bee conveighed unto them by a Dutch hand.</p>
                     <p>Sir! my Lord <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> told mee before M <hi>Tho.

I have by all waies and means ſtudied night and daie to preſent my ſelf to the world that I was ever in all my actions loial to the intereſt of Parlament: in purſuance of that, I have don the Parlament many eminent and faithful ſervices, as is well known to all the Commiſsioners of the Council of Trade, the Committee of the Mint, and many members of Parlament and Council of State: and now in <hi>December</hi> laſt I ſtaied the Silver-ſhips and many other prize-ſhips at my vaſt and great expence. For my doing this buſineſs for the Common-wealth I have at once loſt many friends amongſt the Merchants and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſpent great ſums of monie, and in hazard of my life. If this bee not ſufficient teſtimonie to reſtore mee to my Eſtate, and to have a good Reward, I ſhall humbly leav it to the conſideration of your Lordſhip and all good men. I have in print but given the world a little hint, how your buſineſses in the Admiraltie have been and are mannaged, and ſo for the Mint; but if the State knew throughly how things ſtand in their Admiraltie-Court, and how their treaſure at <hi>Gold-ſmith's-Hall,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119909:31"/> Worceſter-Houſ,</hi> their Cuſtoms, Exciſe, and Mint-buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes have been managed and is to this daie, they would ſay it were time to look about them.</p>
                     <p>The truth of it is, had I been imployed, and impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ever ſince the beginning of <hi>Auguſt 1652</hi> to have looked after all the prize-ſhips and had had a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate allowance for my intelligence, I would have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a great many hundred thouſand pounds, that you have let gon out of your hands, (and is at this daie in <hi>Holland)</hi> whereby this Nation hath been unexpreſsably abuſed, which without God's mercie will prove fatal.</p>
                     <p>May it pleaſ your Honors! Let the hazard, envie, and blame bee never ſo great: nay though it coſt mee my life and all I had in the world, I would diſcover unto your Honors the deſign that was laid to cozen the the State of the ſilver in the prize-ſhips.</p>
                     <p>For doing this ſervice in ſtaying the ſilver I have found juſt what I expected to the ful: for many of the Merchants in <hi>London,</hi> Officers of the Admiraltie, and ſom others ſpout reviling words at mee, as a whale doth wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſom of them have not ſcrupled to threaten my life: and they are skilful at it both by poiſon, or poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard: they are people that have lived in Countries, where for a little piece of monie ſuch things are uſually don.</p>
                     <p>I moſt humbly confeſs were I not ſatisfied in my conſcience, that there was a neceſsitie by God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which put mee on to make this diſcovery, I ſhould not have don it. For I feel it, I have raiſed againſt mee by doing it many hundred enemies.</p>
                     <p>May it pleaſe your Honors! I have ſpoken with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Councill of State; and they wiſhed mee to put in my humble propoſitions, and therefore I moſt humbly preſent them to your Honors, humbly deſiring your Honors advice, and aſsiſtance in this weightie buſineſs that I might bee juſtly, and fairly dealt with, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe Prize-Ships, and the ſilver in them.</p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:119909:31"/>
                     <p>My moſt humble ſuit to the Council of State is, that out of all theſe Ships that I made a Proteſt againſt their delivery, in the Court of Admiraltie, and out of the ſhips <hi>Samſon, Salvador,</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> I may, in reward for my diſcoverie and charge of intelligence reciev all my Eſtate which hath been taken from mee to the value of the ſum of <hi>eleven thouſand pounds;</hi> which is but juſt my own monies, which I have had for ten years unduly kept from mee, as appear's by the particulars hereafter following.</p>
                     <p>With this my humble Petition I have made ſeveral Members of Parlament, and of the Council acquainted; and they hold, that I deſerv a farr greater Reward for doing this ſervice: for here I do the State the greateſt ſervice that ever was don in <hi>England</hi> by any man of my condition: I bring unto the State neer <hi>four hundred thouſand pounds,</hi> at this conjuncture of time, in ſilver, of our Enemies monie; which, if it had not been for mee, the State had been cozened of it; I alſo diſcovered a fraud and myſterie of ſom Merchants, which, if it had continued, would have endangered a ruin of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Dutch at one time, before I diſcovered the frauds to the State, did get out of the Parlament's hands Eleven hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds in ſilver, which wee had once in our cuſtodie ſince laſt</hi> Auguſt, <hi>and now it is all in</hi> Holland. <hi>For this my ſervice to the State I have brought on my ſelf many Enemies; ſo that now if I ſhould not have juſt dealing from the State, and my Eſtate restored, or the value of it, I have by this action for the Common-wealth, made my life bitter, and uncomfortable unto mee every way, and it will for ever diſcourage any to ſerv you upon the like occaſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My Lord! I do the State this ſervice, and ask not one pennie, but to have my own again, which hath been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly taken from mee, as aforeſaid, upon falſ pretences, and I never get a trial, as is well known unto your Honor. But ſom of the Members of Parlament when
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119909:32"/> I petitioned for a Trial even by Marſhal Law, replied, <hi>if I had been guiltie, I ſhould never need to have petitioned for a Trial; I ſhould have had one without petitioning.</hi> A fearful and ſad thing, to jeſt mee out of my whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; they not remembring the rule, <hi>do as you would bee don to.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>May it pleaſ your Honor! For God's ſake conſider what I ſay; there is none in <hi>England</hi> of my condition ever did <hi>England,</hi> in any age, ſo great a ſervice, as I have don, in this very particular, about the Dutch prize-ſhips; and ſhall not my faith, and true love to my Countrie at ſuch a conjuncture of time, bee, by ſuch as you are, whom God hath ſet at the Helm, looked on and cheriſhed? I am confident God will never ſuffer the State to commit ſuch a ſin of ingratitude.</p>
                     <p>I dare ſay I have convinced the greateſt Enemies I have in England by deceiving their expectations, they little thinking THO. VIOLET could or would have don <hi>the Parlament</hi> this ſervice, I have heard ſo much my ſelf from ſom of their own mouths; and, I do verily believ, in their own conſciences, between God and themſelves, they are convinced, that they have oppreſſed mee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly; and if ſo, let ſom Members of the Parlament have a care when they are in judgment, <hi>Not to pronounce a ſentence againſt the light of their own conſciences: for the Oppreſſors that willingly do injustice, to pleaſ themſelves, or others, that are in power, when their conſcience ſhall check them for Oppreſſion, may one day fall under the ſame affliction themſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For thoſe Gentlemen, how great ſoëver, must know, there is a righteous God, who ſeeth all things, and in his good time will render to every man according to his merits; and thoſe that judg without mercie, ſhall have no mercie; and they know not how ſoon God will call their delay of Juſtice, and their forbearing to do men right to accompt; truly the cries of the oppreſſed are many in this Nation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>May it pleaſ your Honors! if I may have my Eſtate reſtored, or the value of it, it ſhall oblige mee to pray for
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119909:32"/> Honors, and then the Council keep's their promiſs, which I faithfully had from many of them, when I firſt undertook to make a ſtop of the ſilver claimed by the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> I humbly ſubmit all to your Honors.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. WHen I was ſent to the <hi>Tower</hi> the 6 of <hi>Jan. 1643.</hi> my Mother had of my Goods, Bonds and Bills in her hands, taken from her, at ſeveral times, <hi>viz.</hi> to the value of one thouſand, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and odd pounds; beſides manie of my papers, and Accounts of great value and conſideration to mee, ſeized, and manie of my papers were of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to the Common-wealth; and yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not com to the knowledg who hath them; but this I am ſure of, if there had been any thing in them that could have made againſt mee, there had been then uſe made of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. My Mother had at another time, a Privie-Seal taken from her, wherein the late King acknowledged hee owed mee, for my expences in the diſcoverie of the Tranſporters of Gold and Silver, ninteen hundred, threeſcore and eight pounds, which money I laid out every penie out of my own purſ; and am ready
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119909:33"/> to make this diſcoverie to the State, upon paſsing of the Act againſt Tranſporters of Gold; which Act hath been twice read in the laſt Parlament, and is in the cuſtodie of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                     <p n="4">4.

                        <hi>Elcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> hath received the Rent ever ſince.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 THat for want of order and a due regulation, and porſecution of the matters of the State's Prizes, and Prizes of private men of War, depending in the Court of Admiraltie, divers great loſſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies have enſued; which, if not prevented for the future, will bring unexpreſſable miſchief on this Nation, and will not onely diſcourage all private Men of War, for continuing thoſe Ships they have abroad, or ſending forth of others; but deprive the Common-wealth of much, if not moſt of that benefit it might and ought to make by Prizes, which are, and have been brought in by the Parlament's Ships; which Prizes ought to bee employ'd towards the ſupport of this War; by which means this State hath been much diſenabled, and our enemies enabled, as by ſad experience ſince theſe Wars began, the State hath found, and by your Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it hath been humbly preſented to your Honors to take ſuch order that there may bee a timely redreſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it bee too late.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That for want of ſtricter inſtructions to all Commanders at Sea for this Common-wealth, manie
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119909:39"/> Ships have paſſed unqueſtion'd, or not fully examined; and manie more are likely to bee permitted to paſs, and never to have judgment in future, and you have had Millions of Treaſure ſuffered to paſs in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; which if it had been ſtopped, had brought the <hi>Hollanders</hi> on their knees before this time. When your Court of Admiraltie and Officers in that Court, are not well regulated, it is a dangerous back-door to this Nation; and by coſtly experience, this State upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination will finde it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That whereas heretofore in the Court of Admiraltie, ſeveral Ships were in queſtion, and upon juſt grounds and ſuſpition, were brought in as prize, (but were not put to plead <hi>ſpecially)</hi> by which means many Ships to the value of manie hundred thouſand pounds, ſince <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, have avoided Judgment and after-queſtion, for want of ſtrict examination, (by which means particular proof might have been in all likelihood found out) theſe Prize-Ships have been diſcharged. It beeing alleged, it is contrarie to the Rules of the Admiraltie; I humbly ſaie, <hi>No ill cuſtoms ſhould bee kept up to endanger the ſaftie of the Nation;</hi> for the Owners of all ſuch Prizes, beeing under que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, ought, by the Civil Law, to prove their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; eſpecially, as by your Petitioner's endeavors, and reaſons given to Doctor <hi>Walker,</hi> your Petitioner made it manifeſt to bee the conſtant cuſtom of other Nations, and that atteſted by the ableſt Merchants in <hi>London:</hi> and by the great care of Doctor <hi>Walker,</hi> hee got a Judgment for the Common-wealth, for the <hi>Sampſon, George</hi> and <hi>Salvador,</hi> beeing the Ships that have the Silver, to caſt the proof on the Claimers, and to cauſ them to prove <hi>ſpecially;</hi> and I humbly hope all other Prizes ſhall exſpect the like hereafter, for I humbly ſaie, it is the onely, and quickeſt waie to curb the <hi>Hollander's</hi> greatneſs, to ſtop them of Trade, in anie Veſſels whatſoever, which will never bee don
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119909:39"/> except the State keep a ſtrict eie on the proceedings of the Court of Admiraltie, during the War with <hi>Holland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the State hath ſuffered very much, for want of diligent and ſpecial Proſecutors or Solicitors, to take eſpecial notice of everie Prize, and for attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as <hi>Remembrancer</hi> to the Council of State, and to the State's Counſel at law; to have this don, is the work of many men, and to order all buſineſs, that ſo no Prize ſhould com into the Court to receiv Judgment, if there were any difficultie, or diſpute in the title, till the State's Counſel had argued it <hi>pro,</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> privately; if this courſ had formerly been taken, manie a Prize-Ship, which hath been diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Court of Admiraltie, and is now in <hi>Holland,</hi> had been confiſcated to the State,</p>
                     <p>And therefore to enable your Petitioner, to do you this ſervice for the future.</p>
                     <p>Your Petitioner humbly deſire's, that hee may have a perfect liſt, from the Regiſter of the Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miraltie, of all the Prizes brought into this Common-wealth, from the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1652. for the uſe of the State, and all Prizes brought in by private Men of War, and what Ships were condemn'd, and the daies when, and to whom; and that the State's Commiſsioners, for <hi>Dutch</hi> Prize-goods, maie bee deſired to do the ſame, that your Petitioner maie ſee they agree.</p>
                     <p>And I humbly ſaie, until this bee don, that there bee ſom employ'd to execute that truſt, to mannage and prepare buſineſs, the Common-wealth's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel cannot execute their charge as were to bee wiſhed, and exſpected; and it is not an Ordinarie Solicitation to finde out witneſſes, and the Myſteries and frauds of Merchants, it muſt bee don by men that have had long experience, and great acquaintance, to get your intelligence; and this part cannot bee acted by the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119909:40"/> State's Counſel: for it is out of their Courſ, they muſt have everie thing brought to their hands; neither is it for the Judges of the Admiraltie, to take notice of anie cauſ further, more than what ſtand's proved before them in Court.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That by reaſon of the premiſed wants in the courſ of the Admiraltie, and moſt eſpecially for want of skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſollicitation, and a due care to ſee every one in truſt to do his dutie; there hath been about eightie ſhips brought in as Dutch-Prizes, and many of them ſhot and torn; many of them had been let gon without judgment, had it not been for Your Petitioner's prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and appealing in the Court of Admiraltie, which hath been followed at the ſole endeavors and great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and expences of Your Petitioner.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That for want of ſtricter Rules in the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, great numbers of Prizes brought in by private men of War have been diſcharged, to the great diſheartning of all Adventurers of that kinde, and weakning the leſſer; but neceſſarie ſinews of this Common-wealth; I humbly ſaie, it is highly advantagious for the State to improve all the force of particular Adventurers both Merchants and Seamen, and to let them have all encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement as poſsible may bee given, for to offend ſo craftie and potent an enemie; I humbly ſay, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſ great Merchants complain, that it is in vain for them to put out private men of War againſt the Dutch, as things are carried in the Admiraltie; and from good hands I have it, that the Dutch doth give againſt this State, all encouragement to their private men of War.</p>
                     <p>My humble deſire is, that the Regiſter of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie may bee Ordered to give mee the particular of all private Ships diſcharged ſince the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1652, and if I bee commanded, I will aſsiſt and ſollicite for to ſee to the State's part, that the Ships bee not diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the future as they have been formerly, through the negligence, if not worſ, of your Proctor M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                     <p>ACcording to my order I attended this daie in the Court of Admiraltie, to ſee what proceeding was about the Prize-Silver which is now in the Tower; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the carriage and paſſages of ſom eminent men in the Court was highly prejudicial to the State's intereſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119909:41"/> about the Silver; and I humbly conceiv, your Honors of the Council of State ought to have a particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                     <p>I beſeech you to acquaint the Council, it fall's out concerning this Silver, juſt as I formerly told the late Council of State, that, for want of a ſtrict care of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining ſeveral Witneſſes which I had ready to produce, many of them have been packed away by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants that claim; and there hath been ſo many delaies in the proceedings in the Admiraltie, that they beyond Seas have had time to laie their buſineſs, that almoſt all the Silver ſhall bee claimed as belonging to them of <hi>Flanders;</hi> which if diligent and ſpeedie care bee taken, may yet bee prevented, and I ſhall make them loſe their deſign.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doctor Walker</hi> did this daie carrie himſelf in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with a great deal of zeal and experience for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie of the State, and made his proteſt in the behalf of the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>Sir! The unlading of the Silver is nothing without making out the proof, that it is <hi>Hollanders</hi>'s goods and Silver.</p>
                     <p>If that ſom Order bee not taken to give a ſtop to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons, and that ſuddenly, they will bee all ſent away out of this Nation, as I am credibly informed ſom have been; and the State loſe their Witneſſes; then the Silver will bee all claimed under the <hi>Spaniard's</hi> title, as now they put in their claims; and for want of a due ſollicitation, by knowing men that underſtand the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret combination and frauds in this kinde, the State will run an hazard to loſe this great Treaſure, onely by the miſcarriages of ſom in the Admiraltie.</p>
                     <p>I have been acquainted with theſe ſecrets this 30 years, and there was not a Witneſs produced in the Court of Admiraltie, but ſuch as I delivered to <hi>Doctor Walker;</hi> it will fall ſo out, all our Engliſh Merchants will run a great hazard to have their goods ſtaied beyond Sea, if
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119909:42"/> the Silver bee taken away and coyned, without proving it to belong to the Dutch, or the people of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, which I had many Witneſſes to prove this Silver Prize; therefore great diligence ought to have been given to examine ſeveral Paſſengers and Mariners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board the ſaid Prize-ſhips, before they had been ſhifted away by the Merchants that claim the Silver; which the State may thank M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Budde</hi> the Proctor for the Common-wealth, for his neglect, if any inconvenience com on it.</p>
                     <p>Sir! If I bee commanded and impower'd as I have formerly told you, I will ſee a quick and vigorous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution ſhall bee had in the Admiraltie for all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer miſcarriages, that theſe frauds ſhall bee diſcovered, and the State entituled to this Treaſure in the <hi>Sampſon, Salvador</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> and ſeveral other Prizes, Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize and Silver.</p>
                     <p>SIR! If I had had a Warrant from the State in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> laſt, to have aſsiſted in the buſineſs about the State's Prizes, the State ſhould have had above a <hi>Million of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> now in their cuſtodie which is now in <hi>Holland,</hi> through the connivance of ſom in the Admiraltie.</p>
                     <p>It would have broke the <hi>Hollander,</hi> and brought him on his knees, if there had been a vigilant proſecution.</p>
                     <p>This Silver had been all let ſlipt away, had it not been for my Proteſt in the Court of Admiraltie, about the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

                     <p>M<hi rend="sup">R</hi> Lievtenant of the Tower did ſend for mee, to tell mee that I ſhould com unto you about ſom buſineſs you had to ſpeak with mee, about the Bullion in the Mint; and when I ſpake with your Honors, you
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119909:45"/> deſired mee to draw up in brief for the beſt manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Coyning of the Bullion in the Tower; your Honor telling mee, the Council of State had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſpecial notice of my great ſervice about the Prize-Silver.</p>
                     <p>You told mee you had ſpoken with the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worker and Comtroller of the Mint, and ſom other Officers; you found them very raw and ignorant in this buſineſs, all, ſaving one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>James Hore,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Burch,</hi> whom you found to bee able Clerks. Seeing your Honors, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Lievtenant of the Tower, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted mee to give you in writing, what in my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience is to bee don, in carrying on this great work of taking all the marks of the ſilver, and keeping a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account of the ſeveral parcels of Silver, Weights and Marks.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Your Honors muſt take a ſpecial care that every parcel of Silver bee diſtinctly weighed, and that no man, but ſuch as you imploie, ſee the marks of the Bars, or Caſes, and that no Silver bee weighed but before one of your Honors, beeing of the Committee of the Council of State, and upon every remove out of the Office the papers of the marks to bee ſealed up.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When you bring your Parcels, you muſt mark every parcel in Bars, Bags, caſes, and Cask, <hi>viz.</hi> n<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1, n<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2, n<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 3, and ſo forward to the laſt number if there bee ten thouſand Parcels.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When this is don, you muſt make your aſſaies diſtinctly of all Bars, and if there bee any little one, they muſt bee melted into one Bar, and a piece cut to make an aſſay; if you finde Plate and veſſels of ſilver, all that is in one parcel muſt bee melted down, and the fineneſs, and weight, and mark of the Bags, Caſes, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels kept diſtinctly; when you melt, you muſt weigh your ſilver exactly to the pot, and keep an account of the waſt back, and that all the aſhes bee ſaved, and at the end of all bee waſhed, for elſ there may bee vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119909:46"/> ſpillings out of the Pots, and ſo you may bee deceiv'd. You muſt have a care whom you truſt in the Melting-houſ while your ſilver is melting; for you may have a lay or copper put in, and that ſhall make it weigh your full weight; but if you imploy M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>James Hore</hi> in the buſineſs, or M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                     <p n="5">5. If you pleaſ, I offer to melt down the Ingots, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are all aſſaied, to deliver unto the Moniers, for the Fee of 12 grains upon every pound weight Troy. whereas S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>John Wollaſton</hi> hath for this 30 years had 16 grains upon everie pound weight Troy; which Office hee is now uncapable of to execute, by reaſon of a late Order from the Cuncil of State, for his late engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the late black and ſerpentine Petition with ſom of the Citie.</p>
                     <p>I made a Propoſition to the Committee of the Mint, about a year and an half paſt, to execute the place of Maſter-Worker of the Mint for an hundred pounds the year, and to melt the ſilver at 12 grains the pound weight; whereas the Maſter-Worker allow's S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>John Wollaſton</hi> 16 grains the pound weight for melting the ſilver.</p>
                     <p>This Propoſition was Ordered to bee reported to the then Council of State by the Committee of the Mint; and I humbly offer to do it for you now at the price of 12 grains the pound weight, and a 100<hi rend="sup">l.</hi> a year; by which offer I ſave the State about fifteen hundred pounds the year, of what the Maſter-Worker and his man the melter hath allowed them when the Mint goes, in ſuch quantitie as formerly.</p>
                     <p>6. Your convenient's and ſafeſt way for your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies after it is coined, is to bag it up in the Mint; and this may bee don for about two ſhillings the 100<hi rend="sup">l.</hi> and let it remain in ſom ſecure place in the Mint, or the Tower, and none com unto it, but by Order of the Council of State, by this waie you will ſave ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119909:46"/> Fees that will run out to ſeveral people, if by this way they bee not prevented.</p>
                     <p>You muſt keep ſom purpoſely to ſee the exact telling the monie; that they keep a perfect account upon Oath, what the Shere make's, and put it down juſtly to the State; by this waie you may ſave ſom thouſands of pounds in Fees; and the State ought to have a juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the profits of the Shere, which amount's uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to 8<hi rend="sup">s</hi> and ſomtimes 10<hi rend="sup">s</hi> the 100<hi rend="sup">l.</hi> by tale.</p>
                     <p>You alſo keep your monie in your own cuſtodie, under your own lock and keie, to bee diſpoſed of as the State ſhall ſee good at an hour's warning.</p>
                     <p>For ſom other directions concerning the uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of ſeveral of your Officers in the Mint; as the Maſter-Worker, the Comptroller, the Clerk of the Irons, and ſom others; your Honors ſee what igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men they are; they may bee aſhamed to eat the State's bread, and are not capable of any buſineſs: your Honors told mee you were ſorrie to ſee the State ſo ſerved in the Mint; the like did the Lievtenant of the Tower.</p>
                     <p>May it pleaſ your Honors, if by God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I had not ſtaied this ſilver, there would none have been coined till the State had gotten more skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Officers in the Mint; and yet theſe men, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, intend to ſtop the arreers of wages they pretend is due to the Maſter-worker, the Comptrroller, and the Clerk of the Irons, out of the monies and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits ariſing by the coining of this ſilver which I cauſed to bee ſtaied, and is now in the Tower; which will bee to the Maſter-Worker about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, and to other Officers twice as much; in all, it com's to three thouſand pounds, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts; When theſe men have ſpoiled your mint, they are very confident men to make any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; I humbly hope the Committee of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue will look to prevent any ſuch buſineſs on their accounts for the future, now they know it.</p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:119909:47"/>
                     <p>Truly I have juſtified it before the Committee of the Mint formerly, and afore all the Officers of the Mint, about a year and a half paſt; That the State had better have given fortie thouſand pounds for theſe laſt five years, then have ſuch Officers as ſom of the aforeſaid perſons in the mint; and this I have juſtified before theſe Officer's faces, at a Committee of the late Parlament; onely M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                     <p>If I had the place of Maſter-Worker of the Mint, as the late King appointed mee, I would know from any part of Chriſtendom, what great quantities of ſilver is ſtirring to bee tranſported.</p>
                     <p>May it pleaſ your Honors! If I had not known by long experience this Art, your Honors at this daie had not had this Treaſure in the Tower.</p>

               <p>That ſhortly there would bee a Committee for the Tower, and then what I had propounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my beeing Maſter-worker and Melter, ſhould bee preſented to the Council of State, and ſom order taken to get the Mint ſupplied with abler Officers; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Lievtenant of the Tower ſaid the ſame to mee.</p>

               <head>For the Right Honorable Col. <hi>Jones,</hi> Theſe humbly preſent.</head>
               <p>I Humbly deſire the State to take notice, that their buſineſs at preſent, is managed concerning their Prize-goods, in ſuch a waie, as leav's a great <hi>latitude</hi> to your Commſsioners, <hi>that are Merchants to defraud the State:</hi> So that their fees in the Sale of your goods, and Merchandizes at 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> the pound, is as trifal, and of no conſideration, in compariſon of the perqueſits
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119909:48"/> and profits they maie make other waies, <hi>(and it is ſuch a</hi> BAITE <hi>profit)</hi> that few men will refuſe it, to let it com to them anie waie; I will not poſsitively affirm, that it is daily practiſed, till the buſineſs is throughly inſpected by a Committee of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>It is this, I am a Commiſsioner for ſale of all the State's Prize-Goods and Ships, and by my Intereſt, I have gotten my Brother to have the charge of all Ware-houſes, and Sellars where theſe goods laie. I have all Porters, Packers, Brookers and all other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inſtruments that are for the buying the State's Goods and Merchandize, com unto my Brother to taſte Wines, and Tobaccos, and to view Corn, Sugars, Oyles, Woolls, Fruit, Spice, Silks, Beads, Linnings, and all other commodities, when I have don, I will cauſ ſom people, <hi>viz.</hi> Coopers, Brookers, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or other skilful perſons in Merchandize, to ſort the State's Wines, either <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh;</hi> Tobaccos, Silks, Linnens, Woolls, Oyles, Fruit, Spice and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commodities, when this is don, I will make a ſale of part of theſe commodities, and reſerv a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of the ſorted and pick'd Merchandize, for my ſelf, or friend, who is a monied man, and can at a pinch laie down twentie thouſand pounds for a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; paradventure old M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:119909:49"/> the ſame rate his fellow Commiſsioners ſold the great parcel of ſeven thouſand pounds, pretending this ſmall remainder is not worth calling for a new ſale, or I beeing a Commiſsioner, will either buy theſe goods in my own name, or get friends to buy them in their name. Theſe goods thus ſorted, gurbled and pick'd from the groſs bulk, maie bee better in the true value then the groſs quantitie of Merchandize, ſold by the candle unpick'd, ſom times twentie, thirtie, naie fortie in the hundred, and ſomtimes where Goods are perriſhable half in half, and above. I humbly leav it to your conſideration, whether the libertie of ſorting, packing and garbeling your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, is not a better trade then the bare and ſingle 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> in the pound, upon the Reaſons aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>To have ſom information of this buſineſs, and ſhew the Parlament the waie to finde out the bottom thereof, and to prevent it for the future; <hi>I</hi> deſire your Honors to make an Order of the Houſ of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>I humbly deſire a Committee of Parlament to view everie week your ſales, and the Printed Bills, to ſee what you have ſold the Common-wealth's merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize at, under M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Daies</hi> Printed Bills, you will

It was ſo formerly in the Cuſtom-houſ, no Officer was admitted to trade, ſo long as hee was employ'd, either as a Farmer, or a waiter, and it was don in all ages upon weightie conſideration.</p>
               <p>This verie intimation, I humbly ſaie, will ſave you manie thouſand pounds a year, naie ſomtimes ſom thouſand pounds in a week, if you pleaſ to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin it.

               <p>Maie it pleaſ your Honors, I had in Offices taken from mee above five hundred pounds a year, which I bought of the late King and the Ladie <hi>Villers.</hi> If you imploie mee for the Common-wealth, in either the Mint, Cuſtoms, or Exciſe, or your Prize-Office, or in the Court of Admiraltie, I will in ſom of theſe places ſave the State a hundred times more then they will give mee for a penſion, if you give mee a fee of 500<hi rend="sup">l.</hi> a year, I will ſave you fiftie thouſand pounds a year, which you are daily cheated of; and this ſhall not bee denied by anie knowing merchant, or others that know's trade that ſhall diſpute it with mee, if they underſtand's the courſ of trade, and are not biaſs'd with a prejudice againſt me, for diſcovering theſe truth's to the State, which in all likelihood, the State would never have known without my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>

               <head>IT may bee objected by ſom that are willing to Cavil at any thing I do, that I have not don well, to put all the Tranſactions of this buſineſs into Print, many things in this action beeing not convenient to com to publick view. To give an anſwer to this objection, for I conceiv I ſhall meet it in my Diſh by ſom that carp at mee;</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Anſwer is,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. THis Narrative is at the preſent, Printed onely for the information of the Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament and Council of State, and the Council of Officers of his Excellencie the Lord General (this preſent Parlament and Council of State, beeing the onely Judges to give mee relief in my juſt demands) the former Parlament and Council of State for whom I did this ſervice beeing now diſſolved as a Parlament and Council.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I moſt humbly conceiv that this preſent Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment having now in their poſſeſsion, all the Silver I ſtaied in the Court of Admiraltie, and ſeveral other Prize-Ships will bee honorably pleaſed to ſee mee have my due Reward, which was promiſed mee by the late Council of State, and that is my eſtate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain reſtored unto mee, or ſo much as can bee by the power of the Parlament, and to make up the reſt of my eſtate that cannot bee reſtored either in money or Offices; the ſom of <hi>eleven thouſand pounds,</hi> according to my particular in this Book <hi>fol. 63.</hi> and this was the agreement and promiſs I had from the Committee of Forrein affairs, and others of the Council of State, beſides manie of the Members of Parlament told mee, I deſerved a greater Reward
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119909:51"/> for this buſineſs, more then to bee reſtored to my eſtate, for that they were of opinion, if once my cauſ of Sequeſtration ſhould bee heard in the Houſ, I would bee cleered of my Sequeſtration. Truly I humbly ſaie, were I in any Common-Wealth in Chriſtendom, and had don them the like ſervice as I have don here, and had nothing to pretend too, but this ſervice; I have heard ſom Travellers ſaie, I ſhould for my diſcoverie of ſo great a buſineſs, have manie thouſand pounds beyond what <hi>I</hi> Petition for as my due. I ſhould bee injurious to the Juſtice of the Parlament, if I ſhould make anie declaration as a queſtion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving my due.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I humbly conceiv, that the former Council were as Factors and Agents for this Common-wealth, and intruſted by the former Supreme Power, and what I did with them, I do the ſame thing (with humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <hi>I</hi> ſaie it) to this preſent Supreme Power, and to the preſent Council of State. I did them this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the Common-wealth and not for any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon, or for anie particular man's profit in the Council of State, and therefore though the particular perſons bee changed in the Government, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth is not changed, the Common-wealth hath the Silver, the Common-wealth in honor is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to do mee right; theſe preſent Governors, are as Stewards for the Common-wealth, and if my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhould not bee punctually performed by the preſent Power, it would for ever hereafter bee of dangerous conſequence to the State, and would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any to ſerv the State. I have don the State in this particular, the greateſt ſervice that ever was don in <hi>England</hi> by anie man of my condition, to ſave them neer four hundred thouſand pounds in Silver of our enemies, in this conjuncture of time. It will ſave Taxes and repleniſh the Nation with monie, and it is eaſie to apprehend what advantages the State hath by it.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:119909:51"/> 4. If I had not given everie Member of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Print, a Narrative of my whole Tranſactions in this buſineſs of the Silver, and Prizes in the Court of Admiraltie, how could I put in my Petition into the Parlament, to have a Reward for my ſervices, and never to ſhew all the ground-work, or original oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, or Tranſactions, upon which in juſtice and equitie my Petition ought to bee granted by this preſent Parlament, they having the benefit the former Parlament had, having by my means ſowed the ſeed, and this Parlament reaping the harveſt; <hi>I</hi> humbly hope they will allow mee a little gleanings, it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt-not muzzle the mouth of the Ox, that treadeth out the Corn;</hi> the State never had had this Silver in the Barn, had <hi>I</hi> not trod and trod again for it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>I</hi> have found manie of the late Parlament men, and ſom of the late Council of State with ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, their followers and friends having relation to them, getting my Papers into their hands, have acted their parts in ſeveral Scenes of the State at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Committees, ſeveral Treaties in Forrein Affairs, in ſeveral Offices, as in the Mint, and at the Council of Trade, and at and in ſeveral emploiments in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which papers of mine <hi>I</hi> have preſented them with, by means thereof ſom have aſſumed more to themſelvs then was ever in them upon a ſtrict examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for <hi>I</hi> have ſate up manie nights and daies at vaſt expence and ſtudie to bring the State's buſineſs about; and ſom others by my papers have gotten great employments (whereas if they had been truly examined of the worth of themſelvs, they would ſom of them been found <hi>Emptie-beaded</hi> and <hi>long-bill'd Wood-cocks)</hi> theſe men having ſerved mee as the hogs doth the man that ſhake's them down the <hi>Alcorns,</hi> they eat them up as faſt as they fall, but never look to give thanks to the man that ſhook them down; bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far from acknowledging my civil reſpects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119909:52"/> them, that for my curteſies in this kind, to ſom <hi>I</hi> have met withal after <hi>I</hi> have been inſtrumental to bring them to good Offices and Preferment, they have don mee ill offices and diſreſpect; <hi>I</hi> ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear naming of them, hoping for the future they will have more of <hi>Chriſtianitie</hi> than to render mee evil for good; many of my friends that have been privie to their ingratitude, have told mee both of their confidence and impudence in Relation to mee as aforeſaid; and this is one reaſon wherefore <hi>I</hi> Print theſe Papers, that theſe Rooks for the future may bee diſcovered.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For my preſenting this Narrative unto the Supreme Power, I am autorized to do it by Order of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Council of State 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1653. to preſent all abuſes that are or have been in the managing of the Silver-Prizes, and by Order of Parlament the 12. of <hi>July</hi> 1653. an Order to examin how the Treaſure coming into the State, may bee managed with the leaſt charge and expenſ, and how all perſons that have receiv'd the monie for the Common-wealth, may bee called to account; another Order of Parlament of the 20. of <hi>July</hi> 1653. where a Committee is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to receiv ſuch Petitions to the Parlament, as are proper to the legiſlative power, or not elſ, were to bee relievable with power to ſend for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Records and Witneſſes, by an Order of the aforeſaid Date, <hi>I</hi> am inpowr'd to preſent theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, for the advantage of the Common-wealth, that ſo for the future, ſom good Rules and Laws may bee made for the Court of Admiraltie; and this Narrative is one of the principalleſt for the ſaftie and profit of this Nation, that hath or ſhall, <hi>I</hi> humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv, bee preſented to the Parlament.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As in relation of the Silver now a Coyning in the Tower.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Several other Prize-Ships, and diſcovering ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral frauds, and breachs of truſt in ſom perſons,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119909:52"/> to the great dammage of the Common-wealth:</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a Committee appointed for the publick Treaſurie, and for the beſt improovment, theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions is for them, wherein by careful mannag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſale of the Prize-goods, they may improve the ſame manie thouſand pounds yearly; the carriage of that buſineſs of the ſale of your Prize-goods, I humbly deſire maie bee called to a ſtrict and exemplar count.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I humbly think that there is not one Member in the Houſ will conceiv his time loſt to bee made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſeveral paſſages of this Narrative; if I knew anie would not beſtow the reading of it, I would ſpare my pains in preſenting them with it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If I would have been taken off of the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this buſineſs, as ſom are who offered mee their aſsiſtance ſeveral times about <hi>Januarie</hi> laſt; now their Actions are turned, they are at preſent for the Merchants that claim this Silver, and act the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants-buſineſs againſt the Common-wealth: if I would have don the ſame thing, I needed not at this daie have petitioned for my dammages, to the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; my deſerting the proſecution, <hi>had loſt the State's buſineſs,</hi> for which I could have had a eleven thouſand pounds paid mee with thanks, anie where in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom <hi>I</hi> would have had it paid mee: but I never have or will by God's aſsiſtance, leav the Common-wealth for particular profit. Had <hi>I</hi> don as ſom have don, (whel'd about) the State had been cozened of every pennie of theſe Prizes; but thoſe that know mee truly, know I am of another temper; <hi>I</hi> deſire all men whomſoëver in this Nation, to give mee a charge to this preſent Parlament, that directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, <hi>I</hi> ever for my own private uſe, received one pennie of any man for any favor, connivance or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waies whatſoëver in the late King's time; and <hi>I</hi> freely have gotten manie man his pardon, from the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119909:53"/> late King: and now I am ingaged in this buſineſs, no man ſhall directly or indirectly draw mee to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traie the State's intereſt; if any can give mee a charge, I chalenge them to do it, (I know I have enemies enough, I deſire them to give mee a charge, I deſire no favor). Upon the reſult of all, I humbly deſire the Parlament to conſider ſeriouſly, how manie men would have ſerved the Parlament ſo faithfully as I have don, upon the ſingle account of acting againſt all Merchants and others in the World, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Parlament, and ſaftie of my native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. If this bee not duely conſidered by this Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and my eſtate reſtored, all men for the future will have a care how they ſerv the Publick, to bring a ruine on themſelves for beeing honeſt to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That wheras ſeveral Honorable Members of the former Council of State, Members of Parlament are named in this Narrative, I do humbly appeal to their Honors for the particular buſineſs they are named in, for the truth of what is aſcerteined, both for the matter, time and circumſtance, onely putting it into a form.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This Narrative I put forth for the information of the preſent Judges of the Court of Admiraltie, that ſo they maie bee acquainted with the ſeveral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes, formerly acted by ſom in the Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miraltie, and that they carefully ſee, that ſuch reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, by Act of this preſent Parlament, may bee made for the due regulating the Officers, and proceedings of that Court for the future, that all former abuſes, and deceits formerly put on the Common-wealth, may bee prevented; I humbly deſire an Order of Parlament, that the Judges in the Admiraltie bee Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to take an exact account, what Ships have been diſcharged the Prize-Office, by Order of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie, ſince the firſt of <hi>Auguſt, 1652.</hi> to the firſt of

               <p>
                  <hi>And I humbly referr my ſelf to the judgment of all judicious men, whether there was not a neceſsitie to Print this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive aforeſaid, for the due and true information of all the Honorable Members of this preſent Parlament; I humbly conceiving, everie one of them having equal and Supreme Power to do mee Juſtice in this my humble Petition, (and I praie God in Heaven direct them) that they maie do mee their humble Petitioner right in this cauſ: for as I am dealt with in this buſineſs, it will remain an Record, either to encourage or diſcourage any for the future, to do the State ſervice in the like kinde.

               <salute>Noble Sir!</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have here preſented you a true <hi>Narrative</hi> of ſom remarkable paſſages, concerning the Silver Prizes, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ships, <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſon, Salvador,</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> and ſeveral Prizes depending in the High-Court of Admiraltie, with ſom prime obſervations of the Trade of this Nation, and for regulating the Mint in the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir! There are ſom men, when they behold a houſ ready finiſhed, they do not at the firſt apprehend the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pins, and beams, and materials that make's and frame's the building; there is many a nail driven, which the Spectator never ſee's; the builder that paie's for it, hee onely keep's that particular account, as I have don for this Book, Humbly preſent you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs, this is but a thatched Cottage, but it hath coſt mee many years pains and trouble, and great expence, to preſent it to you, in that ruff, and unpolliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhape it is in; I have for many years night and daie, had ſeveral helps and hands, both in <hi>England</hi> and beyond-Seas, from choice intelligencers, and out of ſeveral ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts in the cuſtodie of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>John Cook,</hi> when hee was Secretarie to the late King; and ſince the Parlament, <hi>I</hi> have got what I could by induſtrie, from Merchants and others, both at home and abroad, at my great expence, to make mee ſerviceable to my Countrie, in ſtudying the individual proſperitie of every man, that is a true lover of this Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Sir! Hee that travail's far in a Winter's daie, had need to bee up before Sun-riſing. And ſuch honorable Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as your ſelf, ſhall and have no doubt found the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Common-wealth, left ſtrangely intangled, the 20. of <hi>April</hi> 1653. The great God of Heaven di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you to ſet all ſtrait in the Common-wealth; and that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119909:57"/> you may amend what you found amiſs, to the comfort of this Nation, and to you, and your poſterities, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting honor, whereby this Common-wealth may bleſs God for you, and other worthie Members of Parlament, and Armie.</p>
            <p>SIR! There is a Rule in the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> when their Embſſadors com home, the Senate there requireth them to give an account, of the negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Forreign parts, and to declare the conditions, manners, faſhions and powerfull parties and factions in thoſe Kingdoms or Common-wealths from whence they return.</p>
            <p>An Embaſſador of <hi>Venice</hi> returning from <hi>England,</hi> in the late King <hi>Charles's</hi> time, was, according to cuſtom, to give his uſual account in the Senate; hee, after a long Oration of the power of the Spaniſh, Italian, French, Dutch, and Scotch-intereſt in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> their ſeveral influences on all the actions of the late King, and his Counſel, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to give an account of the power and intereſts the Engliſh Natives had themſelvs in their own Counſels; to which the Embaſſador replied, That the Natives themſelvs had little or no power in the Court of <hi>England; for though the King's Privie Council had all Engliſh bodies, yet they had Spaniſh, French, Dutch, and Scotch hearts, and many of them Forreign Prince's Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners;</hi> and the true lovers of their Countrie, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of <hi>England,</hi> had little power in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; the late King having a reſolution to caſt off all Parlaments, and to rule by his own Prerogative.</p>
            <p>The ſad effects of thoſe Counſels, and thir miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, brought the late great miſeries and Wars on this Nation.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ you Sir! I would to God ſom men could not juſtly ſay the like, during ſom time of the late Parlament: many of their Counſellors and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the begining of the late Parlament ſpeaking
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119909:57"/> all perfit Scotch and Presbyterie; and afterwards ſom of their late Counſellors perfect Spaniſh, Dutch and French. SIR! I ſay I have found this a ſad truth, ten thouſand pounds deep and better, to my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar eſtate.</p>
            <p>SIR! let mee moſt humbly entreat you to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental, with all the worthie Members of this preſent Parlament, to remember they are Engliſh, and to act upon true Engliſh principles, eſteeming the good of the Nation above all private reſpects; and their faith and word once paſt, is ever to bee kept, either with particular men or States.</p>
            <p>There was many Noble Gentlemen of the laſt Parlament labored it, and ſtudied to bring it about; but they were over-powred by ſeveral parties, and diviſions even amongſt themſelvs; if there bee any that hinder this good work in your Counſels, I pray God to diſcover him, and to amend and convert him or bring him to Juſtice.</p>
            <p>That which I moſt humbly deſire, is, for every man perfectly and freely (with due reverence I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſay it to the Supreme Autoritie) to ſpeak his Countrie's language, perfect Engliſh in all their words and actions; to bee publick ſpirited men; that is, to ſtudie the juſt peace, wealth, proſperitie and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of every individual member of this Nation; and that they ſtudie the reſtoring of Trade, the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of Manufactures, the ſetting all the poor on work, to the relieving the aged and impotent, even ſuch as have been ſtruck by God's hand, or for their Countrie's defence.</p>
            <p>My moſt earneſt ſuit to you, is, above all earthly things, diligently to prepare Ships, men, and materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for to defend your Dominion of the Seas of this Common-wealth; for without this, you, nor any one member in this Nation, can call any thing their
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119909:58"/> own, longer then it ſhall bee lent them by the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies of our neighbor-Nation.</p>
            <p>And what favor upon their prevailing can bee exſpected by us from them, their former courteſies in the Eaſt-Indies, and their late actions apparently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to every true Engliſh heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon honorable and juſt conditions, for the good of both Nations, God in his good time I hope and pray for, that hee will finde a way to ſave his ſervant</hi> Iſaac, <hi>that is, both</hi> Engliſh <hi>and</hi> Dutch; <hi>and catch the</hi> Ram <hi>in the Buſh, I mean the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>that lately kindled this fire, and to this daie blow the coles between both Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Noble SIR! I have in this <hi>Narrative,</hi> ſhewed you a Watch in pieces, and ſom of the Wheels and Springs that make's the motion, or elſ a Carpenter's Rule, the inches and Mathematical lines. Yet noble Sir! I humbly tell you, the ſhewing a man a Rule and a Watch doth not enable him, without long ſtudie, tools and materials, to make a Watch, or a Rule.</p>
            <p>I humbly ſaie, I had rather bee a Carpenter by daily practice to know how to build a houſ, then a Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matitian by Theorick, which can talk of an hundred things in framing an houſ; but give him a Mallet, Saw and Square, hee know's not how to handle one of them.</p>
            <p>So it is not the Theorick, but the Practick part that can do this ſervice which I have don for the Common-wealth. Sir! <hi>I</hi> humbly ſaie, there muſt bee Men read, as well as books; and many years ſtudie to do this ſervice.</p>
            <p>SIR! I deliver not this paper to erect Offices and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments upon the recommendations of friends, for any in Power, to make ſuch uſe of theſe my humble Propoſals, as ſom of the late Parlament have don. <hi>viz.</hi> To put into great places of truſt, and skill, ignorant and unskilful men, or Rooks; as many of your Treaſurers and other Officers have been; that, by indirect waies,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119909:58"/> have cram'd their purſes, and bought incredible vaſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions.</p>
            <p>Their monies and lands they now have, belong's truly to the Common-wealth, and every particular member in this Nation, have been abuſed by their indirect waies.</p>
            <p>For in the late Parlament and late Council of State, many things were propounded of excellent uſe for the Common-wealth, both by my ſelf and others; but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom any thing took in any other mould, then that ſuch, and ſuch Members, their brethren, kindred, or favorites, muſt have the management of all the Publick Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Cuſtoms and Exciſe, Prize good, Mint-affairs, and all other places of profit.</p>
            <p>And juſtly <hi>I</hi> conceiv they ought to have the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, provided every one of their attempts had been juſt, their allowances moderate, and their whole tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions fairly and truly carried, without fraude.</p>
            <p>Noble Sir, it will upon ſtrict examination bee found for theſe many years, ſeveral publick Officers have not duely accounted for their Receipts of monie, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, by which abuſes of not calling the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers, or Committee-men to a ſtrict account yearly, or oftener, according to the former cuſtoms in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. The Common-wealth hath in their Officers hands at this daie remaining, Millions of monie; which is as due to them, as a man's rent is due when a Tennant enjoy's his Land-Lord's lands; and had all the accounts of the Common-wealth, been kept in a Regular waie, the publick debts might have been far better paid, and the Common-wealth have kept their Lands intire, which hath been ſold at an under value above a Million of monie, for Rents of Lands that yearly might have been paid this Republick, to the World's end, had ſom Members and Treaſurers of the late Parlament been juſt.</p>
            <p>SIR! This Nation may bee compared to the poor
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119909:59"/> man in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that fell amongſt a partie of Theivs, who have wounded us ſeveral waies; theſe Theivs are ſom of the late Members of Parlament, ſom Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers, Committee-men and ſeveral other Officers of the Publick; ſom of them hath ſerved the Common-wealth, as many lewd people do at great fires in Cities, pretend they com to carrie away the goods that they ſhould bee kept from the fire, and for the uſe of the owners, and by all outward appearance in their words, expreſs themſelves to bee very inſtrumental to ſquench the fire, when originally in their hearts and actions they blow the coles, and com onely to pelfer and proline the monie, plate, linnen and goods they can laie their hands on. And the poor owners in ſuch times of f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering his or their goods to any that will band them from the fire; many a mercileſs Theif, inſtead of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this monie, plate and goods, ſafe for the diſtreſſed and afflicted owner, carrie's it directly home to his own houſ, and there felenouſly keep's it for his private uſe, and ſo add's affliction to affliction; when the poor and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed man, know's hee was careful to keep his plate, his monie and ſom goods from the fire, but hath had the ill luck to deliver it into ſuch hands that have rob'd him; who pretended, during the fire, to bee friends, but after proved Theivs.</p>
            <p>SIR! I humbly referr it to you, ſhould ſuch a Theif, com afore you, whether you would not think it to little to make the Theif reſtore to the true owner, the partie that had a great loſs by fire, his own proper goods, ſo unduly and felenouſly detained, and if upon refuſal and denial, and juſt and due proof by good witneſs, or taking the goods in the Theivs cuſtodie, whether you ought not in Juſtice to ſend ſuch Theivs to a houſ of Correction, or trie them by a Jurie and hang them.</p>
            <p>SIR! Let mee entreat you for God's ſake conſider, you having the power of this Nation now in your hands, whether you can anſwer it to God, your own
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119909:59"/> conſcience, or this abuſed Nation, for whom you ſerv, now I have with all humilitie, humbly made you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, if you and other worthie Members of Parlament do not do the Common-wealth right in this particular; I humbly ſaie, it is the praiers and exſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thouſands to have this ſtrictly called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir! I humbly preſent you not with one Theif, but with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Theivs, not pilfering Theivs that ſteal's for neceſsitie to fill their bellies, but mightie Theivs, ſuch as have ſwallowed of the Common-wealth's Treaſure, ſom of them one hundred thouſand pounds a man;</hi> theſe Theivs, lurk not in barns, allies, thatch'd houſes or blinde places, but in Palaces and Lord-ſhips, which they have fraudently gotten; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every Pariſh in this Nation, hath one of the brood of theſe Caterpillers.</p>
            <p>SIR! my moſt humble ſuite to you is, to remember the time of this Parlament is ſet, the daies weeks and months run quickly about, many that have cap't and crouched to ſeveral of the late Parlament men, when they were in power; now Sir, they ſlite and ſcorn ſeveral of them, for abuſing their truſt; for God's ſake avoid that Rock which deſtroied ſeveral of them, which was ſelf-ſeeking and covetuouſneſs, and feeding men's expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation with vain delares; at laſt the tears of the poor and oppreſſed aſcended to heaven, and God in his good time will call to account, ſuch as while they had a band of beeing the Common-wealth's nurſing Fathers, have almoſt ſtarved the Childe; Sir! when this Common-wealth hath caled for bread, ſom of them hath given it a Stone; when this Common-wealth hath been a thirſt, ſom of them hath given it Vinigar and Gall in ſtead of wine to refreſh them; many of them beeing men of no conſcience, no faith, promiſs-breakers and ſelf-ſeekers.</p>
            <p>I humbly leav this to your conſideration, whether theſe Gripers, the Treaſurers, Committees, and others
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119909:60"/> of the Common-wealth's ſpunges, ought not to bee made reſtore what they have unjuſtly deteined, and bee ſqueezed; to cut ſom of theſe men in pieces and make them Hawk's-meat, they will bee as accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a ſacrifice as <hi>Emſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> was in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time.</p>
            <p>Let but the State paie mee my monie out of the Silver I cauſed to bee ſtaied, which is now coining in the Tower; which the late Council of State pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed mee; amounting to the ſumme of <hi>Eleven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds,</hi> I will finde waies to bring into this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament diverſ <hi>hundred thouſand pounds,</hi> which will bee acceptable to all the good people of this Nation, and ſave them taxes; and if theſe Treaſurers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee-men bee angry when they ſee what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, I ſhall value their anger no more then I do ſom Merchants, and ſom others that are mad at mee for ſtaying the Dutch Prize-ſilver; Sir! I had not common reaſon, if I did not ſee and know ſom men have and will leav no ſtone unturn'd to do mee a miſchief for this my affection and faithfulneſs to this Nation ſtaying the Silver.</p>
            <p>But if my ſervice bee duely reſpected by ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie perſons as your ſelf, who is qualified and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred to do mee right; it ſhall encourage mee to proceed in this ſervice, for the benefit of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.
